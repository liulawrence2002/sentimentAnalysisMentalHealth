47326,"Depression in relationships. Did you leave? Would you return? Hello,

My (now ex) SO has been diagnosed with depression. We have had a wonderful relationship built upon many common interests and values, and family blending. He pursued me, and we both wanted a serious committment. 

He admitted he felt depressed to me 2 months ago, when I asked him why we had been struggling to do outside things together. There are a few large situational stressors in his life atm, but he had not expressed the severity of some of these to me until now.

I feel I see the worst of it, but friends get his 'all fine here' mask. Family seem to see more of it too, but they also come across quite critical which I feel makes him withdraw more.

* He seems to not be able to make plans in advance anymore, even of a few days, meaning I cannot clarify if we will see each other until hours/late at night the day before. I have asked him what we could do to make this easier, work with how he thinks etc but he has not suggested anything. 
* When I am visiting him, he is often engrossed in his cellphone, or just wants to watch TV in bed. The feel of absence hurts, but I try to co-exist and just be there. I have expressed this can be upsetting, and that idm if we do our own things together, but I need some of our time to be more about us interacting. This has been up and down, with things having seemed better lately.
* He has become more irritable, sometimes snapping at me or just seeming short all day. I can't seem to get anything right. 
* I feel like we are always having a conversation through a different filter. I could be talking about something abstract, and he will somehow interpret it as a criticism. eg. the other day I had mentioned a friend bought new clothes for her partner as he was in need of some replacements, and SO took this as a sly comment at him to update his own wardrobe. 
* I try to do nice things for him, leaving notes, bringing comfort items, making food, offering to talk if he needs to. He never wants to talk, and the nice things seem to leave little impact after an hour.
* The task of organising our time together is mostly mine, I have asked he share more of this how he can, such as both of us deciding on food options sometimes or suggesting something to do (just home stuff like movies) but this seems to have caused more strain despite him saying he was happy to do it.
* He has admitted he struggles to discuss his own feelings but also told me he will always be honest, which is now untrue as he seems unable to do so. 
* When I try to talk about my feelings on a matter (related or unrelated) he tends to get frozen up and doesnt say much. If it involves him in any way, he has been snapping more and recently and told me he does not have to talk about things just because I want to. I was hurt.

Things took a turn recently, and he ended it. I was confused, as things had been on the up that week. He had started meds a few weeks prior, and had a promotion. 

He said he doesn't know if we fit together but cannot explain why, then that it was actually him because he cannot sustain a relationship right now, then that he doesn't know who he is and just wants to be alone to figure himself out and cannot see ahead of himself or focus. But said he loves me and thinks I deserve better.

I don't know what to think. Is this typical of anyone else's experience with depression and their SO? If so, what did you feel when it was you? Did you come back to your partner if your symptoms improved or you recieved working treatment? 

I have been depressed before, but recovered with treatment, however I can see all our experiences will differ and how people react to a partner will not always be the same. It manifested differently for me, so I am seeking insight and advice on how to proceed.",Depression

19002,"Today I am done. I really am done. I will be honest, I am a teenager, I probably have it easier than a lot of you here. Maybe I will not be forever alone. But I need to rant, I need to get it out or it really is going to kill me. I am 16 right now, yeah pretty young I guess. Back when I was 14, I dated this one girl, puppy dog love, but it was fun while it lasted. Then I hooked up with another when I was 15, that is the extent of my experience.I have friends, they are a good bunch to be honest, but I feel alienated from them. All of them have had a 'glow up'?. What I am trying to say is that all of them have got something good going in life. Some are hooking up, some are dating, you get the idea. But I am static, I do not feel anything has changed for me. I am still the same height, arguably the same face and I feel like a fucking loser. I am average at academics, a little bit athletic; I train karate and boxing.Well today I met my friends. All of them, our friend group involves my ex-girlfriend if you can call her that. Well they all sort of broke of into groups, taking pictures, videos and whatnot. I was the only one left out. Me and my friend had planned to drop off my ex-girlfriend back to her house. What I am going to say next sounds fucking hilarious; but I thought maybe there is a chance for something there. Well that went away as soon as she told some of my other friends that she is not really comfortable with me coming along. I have some self respect of course, did not push after that.I feel like this is the final straw. I have done everything, I workout; I am in pretty good shape and my body reflects that. I speak confidently enough, I wear good quality perfume. I have a good dressing sense. that is what people have told me at least. But it is not enough, I have not gotten anything after my two earlier experiences. I had quit smoking a year ago. I started again, I have had a run-in with drugs, and alcohol. have not let it mess up my life. Completely quit drugs and I drink once a month.Well I smoked again today, I am thinking of drinking again. Might dabble with some safer drugs. I cannot do this shit anymore. Oh I suppose I am a porn addict as well. I have tried to quit a bunch of times. But I always relapse harder. A lot of this may be my own fault, maybe I did something wrong. But it just feels as I have been assigned a certain role in life. A role of rough highs and lows, except there are no highs. My friends cannot really help me, they would not understand. These are supposed to be my ""fun"" years but they are not, I just want to die peacefully at times. I guess whatever I may do, I cannot beat genetics. Maybe my face puts people off, my lips are slightly larger than normal I guess. Probably my insecurity speaking.However, whatever I do and I think I have done everything, I cannot seem to climb the wall. I cannot seem to beat the system. I always feared being nothing in life, but now that I come to think of it. That may be my destiny. I think I will just slowly start destroying myself, I might get cancer or something but I will have some amount of fun while doing it. But that is about it, I want today to mark the day I give up. They say hard times make strong people, I am not one of them and so I suppose it is natural that I will be cut out of the gene pool. I just wanted to share this with you guys, I am still young but this feels like the end. I will end with something I have learnt from experience; you can always fall further, and the pain numbs you at a certain point.I hope some of you make it out, I know I will not. Also probably should add, depression sort of runs in my family, so take whatever I say with a grain of salt. I do not know what to do anymore",Depression

From the monumental effort it takes to drag ourselves into consciousness when we just want to sleep forever to showing up at work &amp; pretending you haven’t spent the morning crying or thinking of hurting yourself or wanting to just check out permanently or all of the above.

I know it’s horrible that we do have to deal with it, but taking a second to recognize how monumentally tough we are is important I think as we always get stuck on the things we hate about ourselves.
It is one positive thing that every person reading this who is battling depression, the absolute Herculean strength we have is absolutely incredible.

If you’re reading this, you are incredible, the strength you show every single day is something that most people can’t even fathom.

7613,"I figured I would rant in a depression sub more than anywhere else. I always feel like I should not have any real reason to be depressed because I live in a first world country where there is an abudance of opportunity for anything you want. However, I have feelings of self-doubt, pity, anxiety and a general low self-esteem most of the time. I am 23 years old and I hate my life. I graduated in Mechanical Engineering in August 2020 and I still have not found a job in my field. This is partially the reason why my depression is bad. I have never had a girlfriend in my entire life and the last girl I tried to talk to ended up ghosting me. I do not particulary blame them either as it is my fault at the end of the day. I cannot beat the depression no matter how hard I try. I have followed every piece of advice I can take such as exercising, eating well, sleeping 8 hours a day, getting sunlight and I still feel like a piece of shit more and more. I would believe this might have to do with childhood-teenage trauma that I have had. My brother was not the best person in my life, which sucks becasue up to when I was 13 years old, he was amazing and awesome. Afterwards, he would because me a lot of physical abuse and mental abuse. He gave me two black eyes in school which many teachers would question if I was okay at home. I was not but I did not let them know that to protect my brother from receiving a bad reputation. I told my parents, but they did not really do anything about it besides a stern talking to my brother. He left me in -15 temperature one time for a few hours where I was just wandering the neighbourhood (I live fairly far from any store so I did not really have a shelter). The thing that makes it worse is that he has a successful life with a loving wife and amazing friends. It makes me sad that people can harm others and still never receive any karma. The next factor is the amount of bullying I received as a kid from my former friends. Surprisingly the ones who became my bully was my friend. This friend is very charismatic and good at getting friends himself. Due to my shyness and having virtually no backbone, I became a really easy target when we started highschool as he was able to convince other kids to bully me as well. The bullying was not anything crazy, just name-calling and making me look dumb a lot. However, they did this every day and it ended up taking a toll on me. These kids are also super successful now and have great relationships. I realized more in University how pathetic and below average I am to my peers. Everyone else can do things much more easier than I can, have much more talents, and are generally smarter than me. I have extreme social anxiety and I always struggle showing my persoanlity around others. Maybe it is a defense mechanism and I will be betrayed again. (Some Good Will Hunting type of shit lol) If it was not for TV shows and the internet, I would be a lot more depressed than I am now. I honestly believe I am a burden to everyone around me and my parents are making it more clear that they do not want me around since I have not obtained a job in my field and am sorta just coasting in life right now.

21466,"Yes I am probably crazy but read if you would like. Maybe I am not crazy whatsoever, maybe the intelligent man simply sounds like an insane man to the less intelligent. Who knows. If a society wanted to put a cap on the capabilities of its inhabitants, it could hypothetically be entirely possible with psychological barriers. Say a society wants to ensure that nobody gets too smart, or enlightened for the liking of the simulation, a swift dose of nihilism could put a stop to the inhibitions of the intelligent in order to ensure that they will not destroy the simulation. A perfect citizen is ignorant, therefore they can slave their life away to the world as they know it, rather than asking questions about that world. If somebody becomes too enlightened, they will not have the desire to slave away for the machine the way they know it to be, rather they would attempt to dissect the irregularities and analysis regarding their existence. As its commonly said, ignorance is bliss, and if you are ignorantly blissful you are not posing a threat to the simulation.What if depression was able to be weaponized in some sort of manner. Instilling a hopeless state of despair into those who pose a threat to a society would ensure that they would not hold motivation to genuinely embark on anything seriously threatfull towards the norms of the machine. It is insanely implausible, but entirely possible, that the simulation we exist in utilizes depression and nihilism as psychological maneuvers to maintain a functional society. If you want to put a stop to the inhibitions of any threat, simply red pill them. Once they reach the nihilistic realizations of reality, they will likely shut down.

47508,"My wife is pushing me away We, both female, have been together for 9 years and married for 3. During the course of our relationship, she has had periods of non diagnosed depression. Well she did go to the doctors maybe 7 years ago and got a few counselling sessions but never went back. She can be fine for over a year and then something switches in her and she just shuts off. This recent episode has been since last Tuesday and she is pushing me away. We have a day off planned tomorrow and she is telling me to go into work. She sits up on her own drinking and listening to music.  She says things have changed between us yet only a few weeks ago we were immensely happy and texting each other how much we love each other.  Yet she is saying we don't do anything and sit in silence. I know this isn't true. We go on lots of walks together, we stayed overnight in a hotel and had a theatre trip at the beginning of the month. I have been away with work for a few days and had a holiday with friends this month too.
She usually loves to make plans but is showing no interest in anything.  She also is quite on top with the house and is not really doing anything other than getting by.

She has issues with her mum (who has treated her appallingly throughout her life) and they are currently not speaking and she lost a close family member 6 months ago so I know things are getting on top of her.

I'm petrified that she is going to end the relationship but I am trying to hide this and stay my usual upbeat self. I've told her I'll stick by her in whatever she needs.  She won't see a doctor or consider a therapist and I just don't know what to do.  She isn't very good at vocalising her emotions and just says she wishes she could have a break from her life for a month.

I suppose I'm looking for answers from people who have felt like this or had partners similar to this so I can figure out if she is just falling out of love with me or is this depression and we will recover.

circling back to the roasting, they will so easily bring up this trauma as a “roast” and something to laugh at, invalidate my mental illness, and make fun of me for attending therapy because i’m “wasting money for someone to tell me i’m normal”. i fucking hate that i can’t seem to let go of their friendship despite how awful i feel about all of them, but i feel like without them i don’t have anyone to do things with or talk to all the time. idk what to do. it’s either be alone and have them in case or just be alone period and obviously that will just continue this cycle of loneliness and dark depression. wtf do i do. ☹️",Depression

I did not know this place really existed... but anyways I have very little motivation to work my way up the employment ladder whether its for a career or min wage job... as I feel so very few careers are really interested in helping people. I am an out of the box thinker and I know most jobs will slice my head if I try quacking about maybe we can serve people first and then profit second...I do not think I have much to say, but I look very young for 26 and it seems that is a turn off for most girls. I initially tried being a psych communications major in college but dropped out as someone in a way handed me a red pill. Since about 6 years ago since that happened, I have been studying different sources on the internet to help me perform at my best if there ever was an opportunity that did not require a degree. But I have little faith and try to make creations and upload maybe assist others in some meaningful way and also make a return. ANYWAYYYSSSSSS I know my story does not sound so bad and I think a big chunk of life is how we perceive things versus how they actually are. I do not have a motivation to get a car or a job because my god mother pays for the rent and allows me free time to make creations, but I do not have a circle of friends that is interested in what I have to share. So I am wondering how I can make money with my stuff without paying for ads or self-promoting. I have asked myself how can I honestly make connections if I do not promote? Some people say offer your work for free and I do offer some stuff for free, but it is quite impersonal type of work and people these days are looking to eat up as much emotion as they can in order to fuel a like or a subscribe reaction. For some reason, I try to stay as impersonal as possible with all my work and it seems to kind of work against me in this type of culture. I am not very attached to specific beliefs or ideas.... so it seems like that is a free ticket for capitalism to rape me.... if this is my destiny.... then what can I do? I have thought about dying voluntarily from malnutrition going out into a rural area and just letting go from there.... but that would be a tough way to go it seems but that could also be a perception. I am not very suicidal to be honest but it comes up. But anyways, I do not really ever share this stuff and I am sorry if it sounds like I am messed up. I am not going to get help if you think I need it. I consider myself kind of an anti-capitalist/materialist but do like small talk and jokes... if anyone of any gender would like to talk and maybe become friends or just talk for a short while without small talk, you would not be ghosted. End: I really do not like how our problems in society are so obvious and yet people play fucking dumb when realizing when someone is having issues... they must be really fucking hurting if they are playing that low... there must be another level of empathy above where I am at if I cannot see that these people are actually hurting inside, but they do a good damn job of putting a smile on their face and saying another day another dollar.

Just overcontrolling and overbearing parents with shit abusive colleagues. Parents left for a business trip, 'bout a week. Two days ago, was melding over my dwindling sanity and the increasing gaps in my memory. I cannot remember shit about any traumatic events I may or may not have had in the past, so it is quite depressing to think that maybe they just never happened in the first place. I have no real reason to be depressed so it is quite likely that I am just doing all of this for the attention. At least that is what I have been told. Cracked out alcohol, since I cannot cry. have not been able to cry for a very long while. Parents used to beat me for crying, colleagues used to beat me as well. School when I was younger was shit, used to get beaten up a lot. Broke my nose twice, a few other bones in my body. Belittled and broken down so fucking much it bled straight through to the point where I had a decent sized portion of my adolescence where I was obsessed with the idea of transitioning to abandon my entire previous personality and set of memories since I could not cope with them anymore. Still fucks me over to this day, and although I might have found a balance for a ""softer guy"" type personality it still does not play well at times. Right, sidetracking. Alcohol. Thought it might help me unbottle some emotion to the point where it overflowed and I might cry again. have not eaten anything proper for months now, usually just half a meal a day, (Think a sandwich, maybe two on a good day), so the alcohol kicked in really quickly. Sisters were going to be back so I counteracted with around 7-8 espressos in a large mug. Looking back that was probably a bad idea. I never got around to crying. Instead, sitting on bathroom tile for hours on end, I just took more and more aspirin with ibuprofen to get around to finally biting the dust. I have been trying for *years* now, it just never really worked out since the probability of a proper death and not just oh-great-i-fucking-survived-and-now-my-parents-are-going to-ship-me-to-a-monastary type lifestyle, but then I just could not give less of a fuck. Necked down 6-7 aspirin and 25 ibuprofen when a really bad habit kicked in. I tend to cut myself. Right around my thigh, so that it is easier to hide. Usually I just cut once twice, never revisiting the same wound but goddamn this time I was persistent. Cut the same area multiple times till I hit the femoral artery. Alcohol, ib, aspirin, and caffeine make for one hell of a whack combo, and then I was bleeding out to death as well. Over the course of the next few hours I proceeded to loose a lot of blood. Funny how the only time I am ever smart and live up to the expectations others have of me is when I am trying to kill myself. I have no idea how much, but I had a really fucking bad fever, tremors, and a few others but I have no idea what happened after I got in bed. Bled through the damn mattress, and the only thing that saved my life was a belt and some salt. Strapped it so tightly around my leg I have no idea why I stopped the bleeding, I do not remember 80% of the shit that happened two days ago, as usual, but the thing that was the scariest was the relentless sense of loneliness. it is why I am here now, two days later. Alone in a dark room, desperately calling every number in the contact book to see if someone will pick up, someone to save me from the same nightmare, but no one is there. I am all alone. I know I deserve it, but it is still scary. After all this time, years on end of loneliness I still cannot get over it. I would say I am a kid at heart but after the things I have done in the past the guilt just will not let go. All I know is that life is fucking scary, man. I apologize for the mega-condensed version of this. Yes this is on a new account, I do not want people in my personal life knowing what the fuck is going on. If I managed to do one thing right, it was hide this whole fucked incident from my sisters and brother-in-law without them guessing what the fuck was going on. I did not touch on some of the finer stuff but I suppose that is to be clarified later. I also know there is a decent chance this will get removed, to which I tell the moderators that it is pretty understandable. Whatever happens typing this out helped me a little at least.

I was born to a mother who would end up resenting me because I did not cure her problems and fix her marriage, someone who would do absolutely everything in her power to make me feel horrible and change into what she wanted, one bad friendship after the next, crippling loneliness, painful dysphoria, and a horrible view on the world (I love people but humanity is something). I would say there is a line between feeling all the pain of your life but not enough to change it and the point where enough is enough and you decide to fix your life. I am right on the edge. I feel extreme pain nearly every single day from whatever trauma and illnesses I have but I cannot for the absolute life of me get any sort of drive. I have absolutely no desire or driving force to get a job or career, I cannot bother to get my license because of lack of drive and fear surrounding it, and I cannot leave my room to socialize with friends. I have no relationship with my family, a father that does not care about me and is absent from my life, and a mother who is constantly around to remind me of how much of a disappointment I am to her, and how she regrets having me. From every point leading up to now, I cannot look back on my life and say I am happy to be alive There are times where I want to rot away until I am frail and sickly, or times I want to whore myself out for any kind of attention and joy, while most of the time I wish it would just be over. I do not want to die, but it seems like the only option I have left. there is no kind of life that appeals to me, and any drive to get better has been sucked out of me no matter how much I wish it did not.

11675,"About two months ago I was out of state to visit my friend of 10 years (well say M) and i stayed for 2 weeks. During this time I was fighting with my boyfriend and she was instigating hard along with her mother which then put me in a place to break up with him. We got back together 20 minutes later knowing this is not something that can be done from another state like this, and M being disappointed in me says do not worry, when you break up when you get back you can come stay with us again. this did not sit right with me because she said When. So a week after my trip while I am home she stops responding to me for about a month, then out of nowhere sends a huge paragraph about how my boyfriend is breadcrumbing me and isolating me from my friends. She said this because when she texts me i take a couple hours to respond. M is however notorious for not responding for days weeks or months. Since over a month ago I have not had any connection with her other than the one message. I responded but she still has not. My friend of 4 years (b) I did not usually hang out much but since my relationship was becoming more steady and we were learning to take out time apart I started hanging out with her more often. She lives about 45 minutes from me but i did not mind since i enjoy the ride. Around a month ago my boyfriend had broken up with me and was very shitty about it, i was sure it was going to be the last time. So i went to Bs place for comfort and to calm down. She makes me promise not to get back with him, and her boyfriend who was also my friend gave me a whole lecture on why my boyfriend is a pos. Naturally I went back to my boyfriend (G) anyway. we have broken up plenty but only gave our belongings back twice or so. Our relationship is more dramatic than anything, we know that but to my friends its abusive. I have reason to believe M and B just wanted me to listen to them. To be in control of me. My boyfriend is nothing like how they portray him. However that is the reason they cut me off, was because i took him back. Most people have just given me the advice of hanging out with family instead but everyone knows the difference between a friend and sibling. I do not have a close relationship with them seeing as i do not do well with the brutal honesty and bluntness of their personalities. The conversation will always come down to why I am so full of excuses when they ask about my mental health. Recently I have been spiraling in my depression and i genuinely have nobody to go to other than my boyfriend but your partner cannot help everything. My social life is important to me and watching my boyfriend be harassed and loved by all of his friends makes me feel so pathetic.

I try to talk to my mom or my therapist and they tell me to stay on the meds because they are helping, but I feel like they are making me feel worse. I honestly feel like no one understands me. I feel like I cannot express how I truly feel because I fear being diagnosed with some even more serious mental illness. Its so depressing to know I have to deal with a mental illness for the rest of my life at such a young age. I feel so stuck. I do not have that much of a social life and I feel unmotivated to try to. I do not even have a bad home life yet I feel so alone. I do not look forward to my future at all and do not even know what I want to do with my life. I hate expectations that society puts on people my age. I have all As grades for this school year because I do want to graduate and maybe go to college, but I do not know what I want out of life. I honestly hate school even though I succeed. I am feel more happy with things that do not require a lot of school, but I know that they will never be long term success and Ill never be successful in life without a degree in something that I hate. Sorry this was all over the place but I just need somewhere to vent. I feel like I am lost",Depression
24210,"Just reread this post and it is a little over the place, but it is late and I want to go to sleep so I will just post it like this.Even as a little kid I did not have interests. My mom used to get me to try different hobbies but I did not like any of them. Maybe that was an early sign of what was to come.it is sad to see someone as young as me not doing anything other than going to school and to the gym. By the way, I have not seen any progress in my body for years now despite lifting often, I just cannot bring myself to eat 3000 calories a day because I do not have discipline. I have only gotten physically stronger, so I guess I am the skinny guy lifting comically high weight at the gym. And while I am lifting, I am thinking of how I do not enjoy doing it.I just do not feel joy from doing anything. I have not been happy since I was a child, and even then I had my dark times. it is a shame, my parents have spent a lot of time, effort and money on me. So far, I have managed to stay alive for them.let us talk about friends, shall we? I do not have many.I live in a small city of around 150000 people. It seems like everybody knows each other except for me. Every time I go out with the little friends I have (who are, I believe, catching on to the fact that I only like hanging out when there is alcohol involved) they greet so many people, and I am the dumbass that is just standing there being sad.I do want to get better, but I am in 4th year of secondary school (11th grade) and I think it may be too late to start building a personality. I am just a she will without interests or hobbies. I guess I can be kind of funny when I am drunk, so that is why my friends keep me around.I am the only virgin in my friend group, which can get horribly depressing sometimes. I play it as a byproduct of being gay in a small city, but it is really just because I have no social skills and I do not enjoy being alive. I have never had any hobbies or interests. I know no one outside of school. How do I build a personality?",Depression

But my therapist is booking months in advance and I have stopped taking my meds. I can feel it getting bad again. But I am working 5-7 days a week and find myself pretending to be okay in front of everyone. The people I used to confide in about my mental health I no longer tell them things. I am pushing people away and I am watching it happen but I just do not have it in me to fight it. I feel like I am just existing, going to work, coming home and going to bed. I sleep most of the day on my days off because life just seems so loud and its turned down when I am asleep. I do not want to die but Id like to pause my life for a little while. The worst part is; my family does not think I am depressed because I can function. They think that I am working lots and that means I am getting better. My boyfriend got mad at me for sleeping till 2pm on my day off.I feel so alone, which is partly my own fault, but nobody seems to get it.

Usually when I am depressed Id take a day or two to myself then contact a friend to meet and cheer myself up. I have (or had...) a great social network of friends and acquaintances in different friend groups who I genuinly all love dearly, but the pandemic, dealing with death, and other personal factors were a catalyst to probably one of my worst depressive slumps since an attempt in 2017. I have not talked to any of my friends in 4 whole months. Even when they reached out, I avoided talking to anyone. I used to use social media frequently, but I completely fell off the face of the earth. Hell, even my internet buddy started to get worried. A majority of texts are just sitting in my messages and I have not even read them yet. Only person I have talked to is my partner who I see on average once a week. 4 months later and I feel an immense amount of guilt, loneliness, and embarrassment because of my withdrawal.

Initially like I said, I felt a sudden burst of happiness because she deserves that success. Followed by that I felt a teeny bit of jealousy, because it is my dream school ever since I was a child, and ever since we have became couples/partners, she has been part of my dream too.

We were classmates for 2 years during highschool and I think I have grown so attached to her that I do not even want her to leave me anymore.But I know better.

I still have my job, I have a great family, and I have my boyfriend. As to why I feel this way, I do not know, and that is what is hard.

47370,"What is this, what is it You can’t help me. You can, but you can’t. You could care, so you can help me. But you won’t, so you can’t. 

I see that now. I was hoping someone would not come and fix everything for me but that they would care. I tried it all, I tried caring so that maybe someone would too. I tried not to expect anything back and I did that but when things got rough and I cried for help, no one was there. People would only take from me, and now that I’m kind of empty, with nothing left to give, no one’s there.

But only kind of. It’s not so bad that I can’t see a light at the end or that I’ll never smile again. It’s that I’ll probably never get the only thing I ever craved for. That’s terrible actually but I don’t know, shit has a way of always getting worse than it is.

While that undoubtedly sucks, life is about more than that for me. I’m not down 24/7, thank the Lord, so I can’t act like my life is over. Get me not wrong, sometimes it stings really awfully and for long periods too. But there’s an entire world out there beyond my own personal lil one that is fascinating, to use one word to describe life.

I should go back in my head. It was always great every time, I would be my own patter in the back and it worked, it works, because I never let myself down in the sense that I always care.

And it’s not like I want to be babied around either. May not seem like it but I’m a strong person inside, I don’t go down easy and every time I do I never stay there longer than necessary. But even the strongest need a helping hand every now and then and I’ve never had that, not genuinely.

Now is one of those times. And what I needed now isn’t even that big a deal. Just someone who would listen and understand. You’d think that wouldn’t be so hard to find.

Anyway. C’est la vie, cheries. I want to go back and fix myself by myself like I’ve always done but not come back this time. It was only when I came back and hoped that I got bit in the ass. Every single time. But no longer.

I’m smart enough to understand and to move on and to focus elsewhere and to do so many other things this world has to offer that fulfill me. One of the best lessons I learned in life was how to take the L. Accept it, let it go and carry on.

Citalopram massively reduced by libido and made it impossible to orgasm, but I did not mind this change at first. At one point I was taking 40mg, which is the highest allowable dose.After tapering off, my sexual function never fully returned and I kind of miss it. it is been over a year now. I was on the drugs for a few years.Prior to antidepressants, even at the age of 27, I would get random erections. I would sometimes get so aroused I would HAVE to masturbate or I would be agitated and could not think about anything else. Not to get too graphic, but I used to get a lot of pre-cum, and when I ejaculated I would squirt quite far, often over my head, and it would be A LOT of volume. It was easy to reach orgasm, and when I did they were intense.Now, the end of my dick is dry and lacks sensitivity. it is really hard to reach orgasm and I am significantly less aroused in the first place. I miss the thrill of trying not to cum prematurely. Now I cannot cum without vigorous stimulation and it does not even feel good.

I leave by 6:30 AM before the neighboring businesses employees show up and realize I have slept there. I usually get right to work, driving Doordash till exhaustion. I have had to pay $1,500 in car repairs the past month and it needs another $1,000 which I do not have right now. I am so burned out, I hate living like this, even though I was car-less for 2 years and it was misery and I am about to sell the car. All I have ever wanted is a place to live, a computer I can play League on, and a cat, and a girlfriend if any girl ever was willing to date me but I will not push the envelope. Today, I did not have the mental strength to Doordash. I asked my parents if I could relax in the spare bedroom if their 2 million dollar beach house but I am the black sheep of the family, the only one without the key to the front door (brother and sister have one). So they said no, get out, I am not allowed to be in their house if they are not there. So I waited outside for 4 hours while my mother got lunch with her rich friends.

47436,"I guess I’m an acceptance….    Seems to be a theme hear about taking hints.  A lot of these posts come in waves.
Basically don’t choose someone who didn’t choose you. If they’re fine without you in their life, then never take them back when they come back. People who are OK with you not being in their lives are not worth your mental well-being. 

In the past when I had read these, I never really understood them. I do now. 
As hard as it is for me to accept, because to accept it means it’s real. They never cared. They left. They’re gone.  Forever. They never coming back. They never wanted to. 

I’m their now. It’s been a long road. A painful journey. One that I’ll never repeat again in my life….ever!!! it isn’t over yet. And by that I mean the outcome of me.  I know I will not be that same I was before I met my ex person. 

      I don’t know if I’ll have that positive and exciting outlook on life anymore. I don’t even know if I’ll have the motivating desire to want a better in life that I had when met my ex. Large part of me went silent. You could even see a large part of my died. The part of me that started to actually want to live and enjoy life..
I didn’t have that part of me growing up even into my early adulthood.  

  

   I listened, eagerly to her stories. I told her mine. I did whatever I could to make her dailies a little easier. To give her a reason to smile. If it was sending her dinners, a random bouquet of flowers with some chocolate and a teddy, or just telling her a joke..(mostly bad ones🫣)
I tried my best to show my person I loved her. 

To me she was the world, my tomorrow’s, my happy, my love, my life, MY ONE…

But to her, I was no one special. In her own words, “there was nothing special about me”.

She took the best parts. She got better. She had options. She chose. She didn’t choose me. I was the one she chose one she had no one else to choose from. That was what I was to her. That was my value to her. 

I have finally excepted this. I can’t lie to myself anymore. She chooses not to be in my life, and she chooses to ghost. I don’t know what tomorrow will hold. But I know I don’t want to see it. The pain within me only increases. They say with time things get better. For me it seems to be the opposite. I’ve always been different. Maybe that is my curse. I’m not like the crowd. Doesn’t seem to be a good thing for me, more like a curse.
I should’ve remain secluded. I should’ve remained to myself. I should’ve known that no one would understand. I should’ve known no one would care….",Depression

Dad low key called me a failure and wants to see me gone from the house. My mom was supportive but she is starting to get annoyed by me more and more. There was not a day that went by where I thought of ending it all,Had to take such deep antidepressant and actively seemed treatment. And after that I thought I was getting better. Entered another college that I wanted and was proud off being accepted. Started going out more and feeling all around better.genuinely thought things were getting better for me. Than one day I ran out of pills to take due to my insurance. Every single day I would feel worse from before. To the point that I started thinking of suicide again. I thought I was finally happy for once and I was improving myself. Find out that all of those feelings where from the Medication and nothing really much of me changed. I want to be happy but I cannot and I am genuinely sure that those medications were the only thing keeping me alive. I just wanted a happy life for once. Why cannot I feel this way by myself. The idea that the only feeling of enjoyment was not because I was improving but from a pill manipulating me to not feel sad.is this what progress is.

17242,"My journey was not easy, and it is not over yet. But I am better, something I still cannot believe today. Anyways, here are principles that I have come to realize and want to share to everyone in the hopes that these will get you out.1. Family is what you make it. Choose them, not stick with them. But be civil still2. People around you are either one of these two: people to nurture/love or objects to use. When I said objects to use, I mean those people that drag you down or does not think of you as important. You should not let them affect you but make the most use of them.3. Just go with what life throws. Be stubborn. If you want something to happen, just keep doing it. you will either die trying and sad or be happy when you finally get what you want. Either way, you get something you want. Either healing or death.4. Make the most of your strengths. This includes faking, pain tolerance (emotional) etc. These things are our demons but we can use these to our advantage. Remember, there are two kinds of successful people. Those who made it by shining bright, and those who made it quietly, in the shadows. Positive and negative. I know this may be confusing, as English is not my first language. This may also sound bitter. But hey, this got me out. Take it with a grain of salt. What I learned throughout my journey to overcome depression",Depression

22942,"Hey. Thanks for reading. I am 22M from Europe and I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder, OCD and anxiety last year. I have also spent some time in a psychiatric ward and was doing SSRIs and benzodiazapenes. The because of my depression was a series of traumatic embarrassments and mistakes which I mostly caused myself. I was never really a good decision maker, even though I have read a ton of self-improvement books and whatnot. I had a real hard time remembering the things I have learned from them and often act out of emotion/impulse. To make everything even worse, I was rejected by a girl I was infatuated by because I was behaving very cringey and she found out embarrassing stuff about me. I have left myself too open and vulnerable to people that did not deserve it in any sense. And it hurts.I am a high school drop out because my biggest passion was to pursue a music career (rap). However, I was also thinking finishing my last year in school and go to college. Mostly because I want a plan B if I will not be able to make money from rap, but I also think it would help my depression. The depression itself is the actual thing that keeps me from doing the stuff I love, keeping me stuck in the past, feeling intense anxiety because I am now afraid what people think of me, and I never had that problem until now. Is it possible to reach happiness again so I can become the athletic, quick-witted, confident happy guy I was before things went south in my life? I also want to dedicate more time to the gym &amp; writing lyrics, but I just lack the motivation to do so. Can I pull myself from this dark &amp; scary rock bottom I am at and fulfill my dreams? I hate wasting my life but at the same time cannot just shut off my depression. Peace. 22 years old and depressed. Can I regain my confidence &amp; happiness and become successful in life?",Depression

22982,"I have had depression since I was 12. I do not have motivation nor energy even for the things I like. I have a smothering relationship with my parents. I am almost 27 years old, with no reason to live, no relationships, and no money. I want to escape and live somewhere else. I will find a dead-end job and find an apartment. No one understands nor tries to understand what I am going through. For everyone else, the solutions are straightforward. Move out, see a therapist, take anti-depressants, get a job, meet new people, read books on self-help, learn to love me more, learn from my mistakes. I have done several of those things. Will doing all those things together heal me? I feel depression will never leave me. it is always been there, talking very loudly or softly at times. No one really tries to talk to me and understand. Everyone just judges me as an irresponsible, lazy, inmature, naive, silly, introverted, boring, square person. No one tries to understand and even if they did, no one can help me.The person in my life which I loved the most broke up with me. She did not love me. And she is better off without me. She confessed how she did not break up with me earlier because of how I would react and be afterward. She was right and I feel like shit and it is not just the breakup. I have tried meditation, no contact, therapy, books, hobbies, introspection, you name it. I am not worthy of love or understanding. I know she knew she did not like who I am. I cannot do anything about that. But no one has ever liked me. that is why I have no friends. that is why the unending cycle of rejections of everyone, including family members.What I hate the most is that I just want that person who broke up with me to reach out. But that will not do any good. Even if she really did love me, like me, and cared, it would not change anything. Am I better off dying? I ask myself this question every day. My presence in people's lives has only hurt it. I have nothing but prove. it is like having a terminal disease. I just destroy everyone around me as I slowly die because I have no convictions, will, desires and goals. But I cannot choose to kill myself. I cannot stand the thought of dying. I want to live. I want to want to be better. But that is just it, I would like to have the desire to be better. Deep down I want peace, to be understood and love, but that does not cure depression. I have even taken medicine in the past. Nothing has helped. I am useless, worthless, just meaningless. I do not want to live anymore",Depression

I can uphold a mask of normality for a period of time, but Jesus Christ is it exhausting. 
In the presence of people, I act. I convince them that I’m fine, I begin to convince myself too. And for a few moments sometimes I forget. Sometimes.
Until I get into bed and I’m staring at the ceiling, feeling an empty sense of longing for God knows what. Why do I feel like something’s missing? 
Emptiness engulfs me at the realisation of the futility of it all. Life.
My body aches, my eyes burn and I just want to be unconscious. 
And I think to myself, is this all that there is?

Most of my life, I’ve felt this dark presence lurking in the corner of my mind. Like a feral black dog following me around, just hungrily waiting to devour me. I somehow always manage to find strength to keep moving, but it always follows. 
Sometimes, I just greet it, and lay down in despair.

I had so many friends, all of which I would say hello to on the way to class- now I do not even go outside anymore. You know, we did not even get a High School graduation? It was a Google slideshow with pictures that we submitted and our names on it. I now attend online classes in my college with barely anybody to talk to, and every time I click the leave button the smile vanishes from my face.My friends were my lifeline; my parents separated when I was young, and I suppose I would go to said friends to mitigate that feeling of family. I live with my mother, but she is endlessly working and always spends her sleeping or watching TV. She says she is working for my future- so that I can continue on in my life well set and without worry- but I wish she would stop worrying about how I feel in the future and worry about how I feel now. With her, almost every thing I do has something wrong. Its never enough: from the way I bring the groceries inside the house to the way I place the blanket over my body when I go to bed, there is always something that has to be corrected. She says she tells me these things so that I know how to do them properly, but she says them with such spite and anger that I cannot possibly believe that statement. I have tried to tell her how I feel on multiple occasions, but she does not understand; she tells me that these things are a part of life and that I should learn how to deal with them. Even if only once, I long for a stroke on the head and her voice to tell me that its all going to be okay.I wish I had someone to tell me that its going to be fine, someone to hold me and tell me that things are going to change for the better.

39436,a little over a month ago i wa over at a friend s house and got to drinking pretty heavily over the night that i spent a his place every so often he would take the bottle away from me and temporarily and hide because he had the impression that i downing a full bottle of liquor at a dangerously fast pace for whatever neurotic reason the idea became supplanted in my head that he wa trying to intentionally hide it away from me so he could spike the bottle with a finely powdered lead in order to cause me to ingest large amount of a neurotoxic chemical to produce measurable brain damage surely this isn t likely whatsoever right it s all i ve been able to ob and ruminate over for well over a month now i could elaborate on a million different pattern and detail and inform you of the interpersonal context between the both of u but then i feel like i d be trying to create and extract a specific response out of people these are the bare bone and objective happening of the night in mention i ve even seen a doctor about trying to get tested for possible acute lead exposure and hinted towards psychological deterioration on a quantifiable level my intuition tell me that my saboteur had successfully managed to reduce my iq by several point and inflict a speech impediment issue which involves a portmanteau synthesis between word in my inner dialogue the way that it wa explained to me from a team of professional who discussed my case wa that because i m an adult it s much harder for a single instance of lead exposure ingestion to be absorbed or produce any perceptible effect or cross the blood brain barrier due to a lack of iron deficiency and binding capacity to red blood cell ergo a test would not be necessary or productive in my case however i can t shake the idea out of my mind i can t dissolve it or even compartmentalize it a i navigate through the day it s escalated to the point where it s infected every part of my conscious thinking and convinced me that i m no longer capable of achieving any of the goal i ve set for myself with my newfound profound disability that are only noticeable to me surely this is something so asinine so comically absurd that the idea should be laughed at the point of it conception why can t i disentangle the idea from my head it s put me into a state of complete inaction i m too paranoid to engage in any socially or mentally stimulating activity because i m terrified that the sting of observing my cognitive deficit in real time will manifest and i won t be able to articulate myself to anyone or anything for the rest of my life and the stuttering habit i never had that issue before never have i ever possessed an affinity for transposing syllable or stating sentence in incorreclty disjointed sequence i used to write quite frequently before this and conversely i feel an all consuming negation of my emotional affectivity and spontaneity my thought aren t being organically generated and i feel a if i have to strain to think of anything lucid or insightful is it natural to feel like your thought have been utterly attenuated and obliterated with anxiety is it normal to feel a if time is accelerating itself faster than your consciousness can adapt to it progression is it natural to feel former part of your identity and desire to become increasingly disfigured obscured and foreign to yourself the aforementioned friend that i spoke of no longer talk to me a we had a falling out with one another over a relationship that wa rife with gaslighting think of the breadcrumbing tactic some narcissist employ maybe that spurred the main causal effect for why i m patternizing my memory in the way that i am but pouring granulated lead into my liquor without me noticing or it producing any physiological effect that s laughable right,Depression

12706,"I know I am not ok. Yet I cannot help but wonder now with the media constantly telling us that depression is real and is crippling so many people out there, its becoming this massive self fulfilling prophecy for the whole of society. I show just an ounce of self pity and self deprecation and I can instantly feel the compassion and pity and sympathy from the other person. It feels weird. I feel like I use it as a tool of manipulation for times when I know I could have done better. For times when I know I did not step up and pull my weight. Yet I feel so dead on the inside I have no motivation to even tidy my flat or feel the need to achieve anything ever f*king again. I feel too far gone as if I can never ever be truly happy again. I wish I did not grow up with social media and unrealistic expectations. I feel like my mind has been poisoned and there is no antidote that can fix it. The path to healing seems so overwhelming and long I just cannot be f*kd. The road to inner peace and happiness seems impossible. I do not feel the need to be better anymore. I cannot be bothered with my appearance, my career, friends or dating life. I am just waiting to die. I do not want to tell the few close friends that I have how I am truly feeling. I do not want to bring them down or have them worry. I do not want their pity. I do not want to tell my family. At the end of the day its up to me whether I want to improve my life or not. I just feel so dead on the inside. I am not ok. do not know what to do. But is depression even real tho",Depression

27171,"I am a bubble floating through a vast empty void. I do not know what to do. I wake up every day and do the exact same thing. I feel a heavy force pulling me deeper into my home. The anxiety I feel over thoughts of leaving my fortress gives me physical pain. I have no purpose to move in any direction except back and forth. I sometimes feel that I am losing grip on reality. I feel consumed by the screens in front of me. Dependent on them for warmth. I write to myself every day, just like this. Today I decided to allow the public to digest my psyche. Perhaps to give me a better understanding of myself through unbiased eyes. I am gripped with fear. There is a xenomorph hammering my inner chest plate. Please do not judge me harshly. I am always alone. I should clarify; I have an elusive partner. My partner is an alcoholic drug user with a gambling addiction. They are also a hell of a go getter with a can do attitude. Observance prevents me from assimilation. Sex is a drug purchased with guilt. We have brief moments together where we exchange pleasantries before going about our days.They have a demanding job but are payed sufficiently well, all things considered. I do not have a job. I have had jobs. Too many jobs. I counted once. 22, I believe. My plethora of different career paths has been both a blessing and a curse. I am well read with a variety of skills. I feel consistently overlooked. I am average height. I feel my partner has resigned themselves to the inevitable descent into drinking alone at the video poker machines. We are both 32. My partner is well liked in the community. I am a shadow. I make the rare appearance at a function or two. I typically do not eat. My choice to eat or not to eat will be my martyrdom. I have not pinpointed why my body has become the offering. Although, I can provide a generous list of options. People seem to enjoy my company and compliment me on my looks and body. I am clean, well dressed, and have been told I have an intimidating presence. I hold a conservation well and have good comedic timing in the moment. My jokes are dry. Much to my dismay, I am not a large person. I am frail. I feel myself diminishing. My soul is drifting towards the event horizon. My partner and I played jeopardy once. The fight lasted for a week. I question my memories. When I speak of fortnight's passed, my words are taunted, belittled, questioned, or worst of all... Ignored. A victim chooses to be a victim. The poor choose to be poor. The path was paved for a different vehicle yet only I am to blame if I cannot pass. The fault is mine. My mind drifts through consciousness. Nicotine and constant vigilance vibrate through my sleepless body. My fears are desperate for attention. I exist only for brief entertainment when all else fails. I am the sideshow to a sideshow at a zoo. My only solace is found by translating thoughts into little notes that I leave for myself. Even now I question the weight of my words. My screams are yawns to the deaf. Wailing is no use when I am trapped in a bubble, floating through a void.Please advise. Please advise.",Depression

20643,"I am 41. Not sure exactly how I got here but I honestly feel cursed by god or the universe or whatever forces are at work. I have felt depressed for about 25 years now. And before that, as a child I felt different, weird, isolated, and alienated. I was 18 before seeking real help, when someone at my university asked me ""Have you ever considered killing yourself?"" and it occurred to me that that was not normal. I have been on most of the major antidepressants. I have been hospitalized twice. I have seen countless doctors, therapists, psychiatrists, psychologists and still I am in the same place. I have reached out to TMS and Ketamine places but have not gotten anywhere. I have tinnitus and have taken a number of blows to the head throughout my life but never been sure if its related to the depression. I have a supportive family and even a great wife and I feel terrible for relying on them so much financially and emotionally while not being able to make progress. My main problem seems to be that I do not feel like I am a part of anything that is going on. I do not understand what is going on. I do not know what I am supposed to be doing. Everything seems wrong and all I see is chaos and confusion. I am honestly trying my best to survive and thrive but it just keeps getting worse. I went to college because I thought I wanted to be a filmmaker. Now I barely even enjoy films or it feels like every idea has been done. I knew I could not network or assemble a crew or any of the necessary things I would have to do. The most I was ever able to do was to make wedding videos.and hire maybe 1 other person. I decided to stop doing that, got a job editing short promos for TV shows which gave me a portfolio no one seems to care about. Worked for local government creating media before getting fired for voicing concerns about noise in the office because I am so sensitive. Then with no one hiring me, I had to go back to driving which I have done ever since I was able to work. I used to think driving made me feel free and I could be alone with music, podcasts, and my thoughts, but now I do not want to be alone with my thoughts because all I think about is killing myself all day. For two years, I transported dead bodies which was super depressing. Now I work for FedEx and its hot, noisy, and extremely strenuous. Every time someone tries to help me with a job prospect it leads nowhere, to the point where I do not even want to accept the help. I have been rejected from so many places that it seems I would be qualified for. I look for jobs all the time and they all look really bad or do not pay much. And the process takes so much time only to be rejected at the end. I want to quit my job but only have spotty gig work to fall back on. I feel like a failure and that I cannot contribute financially.I do feel gratitude for the things I have. I have tried journaling, meditation, yoga, exercise, and plenty of the other things people suggest you do. But my mind stays locked on past mistakes and cringey moments. I beat the shit out of myself all day everyday and cannot stop. I compare myself to others, get jealous, and get angry that I cannot be normal or successful. And it feels like I am getting dumber, more forgetful, and harder of hearing when I need to have all my faculties working as well as possible. It just seems I am getting older and my life gets more sad and embarrassing. I barely want to leave the house because I am sensitive to the horrible things I see or situations I might end up in.I do not know what to do anymore. I am scared of getting older and how it could possibly get even worse. I need help but I cannot seem to get it. Everything is out of reach. Everything seems impossible.

18897,"When I was 15, my family sent me off to a treatment center after a few runs away, an overdose and two attempts at my life. I did really bad in the program but there was one therapist who really really helped me a lot we will call her P. I originally had a therapist that my parents requested because he had the same religion as my parents but he was not helpful. About 4 months in to my program, I got in some legal trouble and that therapist threw up their hands and went to the board to have me removed from the program. P freaked out in the board meeting and told everyone that giving up on people who need help is not what this program is about so she made room for me on her plate and the board let me stay in the program. I saw her nearly every day and wed talk about everything. She knew me way better than I could know myself. If I did not graduate the program, I would be put in a higher security treatment program or to juvenile hall. She was always my advocate and she made sure that I graduated even when my parents ran out of the money they got from the second mortgage they took out to pay for my program. Right after I graduated from the program, I found her on facebook and we chatted from time to time until it eventually stopped for no reason. I eventually stopped using my facebook but I kept it because that was the only way I could get ahold of her. It is now 15 years after I entered the program. I just turned 30. I own a successful business, own a house and have been married to the love of my life for 5 years. I have been spiraling deeper and deeper into depression for the last three years. I have no reason to be but it has been happening. I have been to psychologists and counselors, I have been on medications, I have tried to talk to my spouse but that is a story for another post. Nothing has been working and my thoughts are darkening to the point that I fear the worst for myself at my own hand. I keep thinking about the days when I could just go into Ps office and talk to her or see her walking the halls and ask for a chat. Last I heard, she moved to a different program and eventually retired in Colorado with her husband. She probably barely remembers who I am because there were 50 kids in the program at any given time being seen by 4 counselors, the average program lasted 8 monthsso that is a lot of faces going in and out of there. I am wondering if anyone thinks it would be strange for me to reach out to the only therapist that worked for me 15 years later? The only therapist that helped me",Depression

10382,"I am 27M and I have been feeling depressed for as long as I remember, I cannot recall what it is like not feeling this way. However, I was never officially diagnosed. I have always said to myself I am just sad, lonely or whatever. Now I am scared to go. Scared that there is actually nothing wrong with me and this is who I am. Scared that I cannot be fixed and will be like this forever. Majority of depression stories have some kind of trigger, some kind of trauma. I had nothing, my childhood was fine, I was not bullied, no one died when was I young. These thoughts and feelings of sadness, numbness, apathy just slowly creeped over me and now have swallowed me whole. Things I used to enjoy no longer interest me. Things that I used to escape no longer help. Due to these feelings and my social anxiety I never developed any close friendships and/or romantic relationships. I keep wanting to talk to someone but there is no one really to talk to. And, hell, even if there was, I have no idea how to talk about this. At this point I feel like I will be alone till the end. And maybe that is for the better, no one deserves to be stuck with a loser like me. I let it get to this point, I do not deserve love, I am not owed anything. Anyway, I do not know why I wrote this.

Yes, I am really depressed if you have not figured it out yet, but I was born like this, not a day goes by that I think about getting my nose or ear done again, most likely I also have a problem with my teeth or gums, which causes me to have a costantly bad breath,even if I clean my teeth several times every day, and I keep myself vert clean physically, but I do not know, I do not know what sense it makes for me to continue living this way, waking up and noticing that I am the only one to have all these problems, the only thing that perhaps makes me happy is the fact that my grandparents really loves me.

I recently lost a job I actually liked because my mental issues got too much for me and now I have a job I literally hate and it even pays me less.

My bills are piling up and my bank account is at about a dollar and that's including savings. It feels like nobody cares that I'm struggling and I'm sure by the end of the week I won't even have a phone to use for applying to other places and even if I do how will they call me for interviews?

Honestly if it wasn't for my grandparents I would just kill myself because I'm just sick of life and people, I'm just happy that they aren't aware of my problems because I don't want to stress them out.",Depression

47127,"Feel like a loser because of how broke I am at almost 30 years old I'm 28 right now and I graduated from college in the Fall 2017 with a bachelors degree in psychology and after realizing I wasn't going to do much with that degree as I've completely lost interest in that field. Since 2018, I have been working as a part-time student advisor making less than $20k annually as I was very undecided about the direction my life was going to go and it was like this for 2 years until I decided to return to college to take prerequisite courses for graduate school so that I can get into a data science graduate program. 

I'm currently in my program right now and I have been keeping a 4.0 GPA and this gives me a lot of hope but I've noticed that some of my friends (including my love interest) make much more money than I do and have their own places. My love interest told me that I will eventually get out of my situation and we still had very passionate sex when I last visited him and we exchanged our gratitudes for each.

But its like, I'm very disappointed at myself for allowing myself to be where I am today. If I had known from the beginning just how much my socioeconomic status would affect my prospective friendships/relationships, I would have taken things more seriously and considered a field that was more lucrative when I was an undergrad.",Depression

10375,"So I am 20, male. Still at their place. Still in the house of the man who, on multiple occasions, had tried to choke me to death. Still in the house of the women who took his side when he tried doing what he had done, while talking shit behind his back about him. Still in the house of twofaced individuals who maintain the image of good, just, kind, outgoing people. Whenever I told my situation to anyone who knew anything about them, the response was the same - ""your mother loves you more than anything, your father is so funny, your depression is making all those things up, get a grip"". I do not even know if I am even remembering things correctly or if I am making things up. I have no proof of being beaten, of being yelled at, of being manipulated, of being persistently made fun of, I have none of that. Hell, the only reason I am working right now is because of my father. Of the same father who was only present in my life to berate me, to beat me, to try to kill me. Granted, I have failed a lot throughout my life, I did not study at all, I was at my PC all day, so I sort of do entertain the idea of me deserving all this. I did waste my life and academically, I did not do shit. I dropped out of college too and I feel like the only reason they have accepted this decision was because they just all gave up on me. My mother, father, sister, grandmother they just do not give a shit anymore and it makes me miss the yelling, the beating, the threats, because at least then, they had cared about me. And now my only plan is to move out. Not even to a different town, just a different place. But what about after that? I will still be a friendless loner with no life skills, with no life experiences, with no talents, with a minimum wage job, what then? I will still be alone, all by myself. Maybe I deserve that. I do not even know anymore. I am trying to be as objective as I can, but through my own perspective, I cannot. I am just so tired of being alone, of not fitting in. I am tired of knowing a fuck ton of people and telling all of them about how I should have killed myself and how I have no future, no ambition, nothing. I am tired of not having anyone to love, of not belonging to a group of people that will just do whatever the fuck. I am tired of my prime being wasted. I am tired of not having that wild life that I am supposed to have by now, because I have no one. I am tired of being the incompetent extrovert who can talk to people, but cannot be with people because I leave them all or vice versa. I just do not know what to do anymore. Daydreaming about doing the over the top proposal to the one is beyond pathetic given that reality will never happen. Daydreaming about making it big with music is beyond sad given that I do not have the talent nor do I know anything about mixing, mastering, processing and shit like that and my voice is pathetic. Daydreaming about being at peace with myself is beyond unreasonable given that I have been alone for so long that I feel like I have gone insane already. I am just lost, what am I supposed to do given that all the psychiatrists are scam artist scumfucks?

He was going to put the deed in both of our names, but take on the loan in his own since I did not graduate with my doctorate until this May. Fast forward to February when his family fell apart when his Dad (and his best friend other than me) hurt his mom (in addition to other difficulties in his life not involving me). It was like someone flipped the switch off in his brain. He said he felt numb. Like a piece of him died inside. It continued to get worse until it felt like he hated me. He said mean things, would hang out with people he never hung out with before and seem truly happy, but when he got home he was emotionless again. He did not talk. He lost interest in sex and if we did have sex it felt cold and emotionless. He assured me he still loved me but it did not feel like it anymore. In the first week of May he seems to perk up and finally opened up about feeling depressed and I left for 2 nights to go visit family and he went right back to numb. I texted him and went off because I could not take it anymore and asked him to fight for me but he said he could not. A few days later he told me we fell out of love. I recently heard about anhedonia and it seems consistent with a lot of his sudden actions and ability to have excitement with only some people. I do not expect to get back together, but some kind of understanding of an issue that I do not understand or personal experiences would be appreciated. I am struggling but in a different way. I tried to be enough, but I regret not realizing he may have needed professional help. I know this is for those with depression, but I could use some advice",Depression

I have been depressed for years, but when my sister died last month things have got ten times worse. to top it off, she was cremated, and she was nine. Fucking NINE.I still feel like a bitch for being angry at it. I had to delete my last account after i got bullied because I posted about my frustration on a grief support sub. it is not fucking fair. I had people tell me to grow up, calling me a sensitive bitch, swearing at me and villainising me because I am pissed off a nine year old girl was burnt to ashes.

I do not care that the bitch who did her cremation sent me a tacky memorial gift and a necklace with her fucking powdered bones in it that I did not ask for anyway.

Today I called him to see if I can try stopping. He did not suggest it since he said that it could take 6 weeks to see any effects. And that trying to go back on it if I decide I need it is bad.I asked if he was going to wean me off or just make me quit cold turkey. He said that I should just stop cold turkey. Now I know that when I miss a dose or two I get bad headaches/brain zaps, become really irritable, and get sick. So him saying cold turkey is fine makes me feel really scared. I have read up on other peoples posts that effexor xr is the worst to stop cold.I was wondering if I could either A) break the few pills I have left and self wean or B) try to find another doctor as a new primary care physician/ second opinion.Any advice is greatly apricated.

47934,"not sure about what to do with my life. For the past 4 years I've (18m) struggled with depression, I guess it started with the very turbulent divorce of my parents (a violent fuckfest) when I was 14yo in 2019, it was at that time that I started doing drugs such as mdma, lsd and cocaine, however I'd say my drug consumption really started as young as 12 given that I would abuse my adhd medication (ritalin) by snorting it.
Later down that year I had some pretty shitty moments with my mother (physical violence) as my father abandoned us to go live in another country for half the year, when he came back, they found out about my drug usage, which again ended up in physical abuse and the over infantilization of a 15 yo boy who never had any freedom or power in his life, my parents started walking me to school (it was 2 blocks away from home lmao), once they even punched me infront of my classmates and threatened some random boy about beating him up because they confused him with someone I smoked weed with.
At the end of that year they sent me to love with my grandma in another country.
There I was, all alone in a country that was foreign to me although I was born there, I had family of course, but I can't really be myself around my family, the year was 2020 and I was just starting classes again when the pandemic hit, it was at that point when I abandoned my studies for the first time, tbh I didn't suffer through covid because I lived with my cousin and we played videogames all day, but I ended up drinking a ton of alcohol in secret again, sniffing gas from the stove, stealing pills from my grandma, because I was desperate, life felt like it physically weighted on me,
I stopped eating because sadness did not allow me to, I started getting weaker and weaker untill 10onths later my mother picked me up and we returned to tje country I was raised in.
It did not get better for a long time.
My mother did not trust me at all and didn't allow me to go outside (I was 16 at the time), she even hid the keys from me.
As I realized that she would never trust me again I said fuck it and started smoking weed again, yadda yadda I start studying again and pass the year (yay), but still, I was a 17yo boy who isolated himself for 2 years and didn't talk irl to anyone that wasn't family, I developed a serious internet addiction due to it.
In 2022 stuff got slightly better, but not really, during summer break I met a girl (26yo) online, and we start talking, we like each other, the first time I left my house in years for something that wasn't school was to meet her, which I did, at the cemetery, I was 17.
Later in that year I get into an altercation with my mother and she beats me again and kicked me out of her house, after that I live with my father for a couple weeks before she decided to ask me to come back home again (she never said sorry), I get even more depressive to the point I abandon my studies again.
Then I become 18 years old, and this 26yo girl I talked about before asks to unvirgin me (to which I said yes), she invited me to her brother's bday party.
When everyone went to sleep, we were in bed together, I was sleepy and high, and she was drunk and coked tf up, we had a very awkward kiss, I then say that I forgot to bring condoms and she mounts me anyway before I could say anything.
After that shitty experience we become a couple, my first girlfriend ever yay.
Fuck it was a rollercoaster of shit, she was abusive, she offered me coke after I was clean for 3 years, she insulted me and said I was only useful for sex, she even slapped me a couple of times.
Why does everyone abuses me?
Now, 2023, I have my first job, but I still struggle with my weight, which makes me very self aware of how weak and small I am.. I feel ugly, I feel emasculated.
Now I have to study again and I just can't keep up with study and work (my work shift goes from 4am to 12pm, and my classes go from 6pm to 12am)
I just want to give up, I feel like I don't deserve anything, I just want to sleep and sleep and wake up when everything's allright.

47472,"Tired Hi everyone, M25 here

I'm currently living in Lebanon where we have been suffering from a very bad economic crisis. Our currency has been devaluating at a rate where the prices go up every day.
Due to that crisis, most people my age have been immigrating and looking for jobs abroad.

I am currently getting paid a livable wage, can't complain there. I can go out to restaurants, and pubs and do activities when the majority of people can't. Note that my salary isn't considered high, I have friends who earn double and triple my income.

I majored in business administration so finding a job abroad, unlike my engineer friends, is next to impossible.

I am tired. Tired of living each day the same as yesterday. Tired to see more of my friends leaving. Tired of being alone. I'm stuck in a mental loop. Most of my friends are living their life, travelling with each other, and making memories while I'm stuck here.

I am very close to the girl I like, but she doesn't know, and seeing her miles away from me is heartbreaking. I can't make a movie knowing it will be agonizing for us to start a relationship long-term while being in my current state. Knowing she is out there spending time with our friends, making memories with them when I can't be there is crushing me more.

I was heavily depressed for several years when I was younger and managed to overcome it and be happy for a while. It seems like the depression is creeping up again.

I used to be a blanket without seams, a silk cocoon of happy dreams. Now I'm a quilt, no square the same, a patchwork of pleasure and pain.

I feel useless. Each breath I take is meaningless. Breathing is not living. I want to live. I want to be happy.

I am not suicidal. I want to overcome it. But death wouldn't be so bad right now.",Depression

Threw the kitchen sink at it before eventually being convinced by a therapist that I should try medication. Things got worse.

I have been med free since late 2018.The depression triggering incident has reared its head once again. Clearly I am not over it and have work to do. That said, my current regimen to stave off the black dog is thus:No alcohol, zero sugar, regular exercise, daily meditation, daily cold water therapy, lowering caffeine intake, CBT, and as ever reading a ton on the subject.Right now I am nearly as low as I have ever been: frequent crying fits, anxiety attacks, self harm, those thoughts etc.I discussed the idea of using SSRIs in moderate doses with my SO, and she flat out said that she disapproves of the idea. She says it changes me, and that she thinks I should keep trying everything else that I am doing. I guess I am here as a cry for help - am I letting down my partner by seeking medicinal help?

Instead...she died. I suspect she took her own life. No one told me. For 13 months I held resentment towards her. I didn't want to be with her but I was upset that she had made our relationship toxic.

8389,"All this time I knew something was wrong but I never really knew what. I thought I hated my body, I thought that I was sad because the boy I liked did not like me, I thought I was sad because my parents never understood me. But those were all the things I would tell other people when they asked if I was okay, although I never really cared about any of that. The truth is I do not really feel anything. I try to pretend I care about things to seem normal to other people and I pretended for so long that I ended up believing my own lies. I was so out of touch with my feelings I had no idea I was actually depressed, I thought I was living life the way it is supposed to be lived but it never felt right. I have never taken my future seriously, in fact I have never taken anything in my life seriously. I got arrested for shoplifting, and while my friend cried I started laughing, because I really could not care. I do not care about my studies, I only have good grades because I am asked to. I do not even feel happy or proud when I get a good grade. I do not have any real life project or expectations for my future. I have been living all this time letting other people decide for me because I do not really want anything. Nothing motivates me. When I was a child I liked to draw, to read, to write. None of those things motivate me anymore. I thought I was happy because I partied, I drank, O smoked weed and hung out with my friends. I thought I was happy because those things made me feel alive. When I am alone I just pretend I am living a different life, but I never thought that was fucked up because I thought it was normal. I want to know if people that are not depressed experience life differently. Do they seriously care about things? Everytime something bad happens to me, it is almost like it happens to someone else. I feel emotions as if I was deep inside of the ocean and there were muffled sound coming form the outer world. it is almost like I drown my own emotions. If someone insults me, if someone hurts me, if someone rejects me I never really cry about it or feel sad or anything at all. it is like I have become numb.Nothing makes sense. Nothing here makes sense. it is like I do not know how to be alive. I thought it was completely normal to go to sleep late, to eat too much or too little, to feel tired all the time, to never be able to concentrate. But now some stupid online test tell me that those are symptoms of depression. I thought everybody was just pretending like I did. This is such a different type of depression. I have experienced hate for myself, I have experienced anxiety and hate for my body. I thought THAT was depression, and the nothingness and the pretending were all just part of my personality, just the way I was born. I do not know how to be different, I do not know my feelings or myself. I do not really know or want or feel anything. it is the strangest feeling, and I know it is been there all the time but I never recognized until now. I think I have been depressed for years but I did not know",Depression

22108,"I need advice; worried about my boyfriend I am not a doctor, but I am a nurse. I have been dating my boyfriend for over 1.5 years and living with him for about a year. Generally speaking he is a very anxious/paranoid person. He also has days where he cannot get out of bed and feels down. He also has serious social anxiety and does not trust most people. I have wanted him to see a doctor about this for a long time, but he was afraid of taking medications and did not want it to change who he is. That being said- He was recently in a bad car accident. The people that T boned him died and he is really torn up about it. His friend that was in the car with him is also now money hungry and states that he is going to come after my boyfriend financially somehow even though the accident was 100% not his fault based on what happened and the police report. His car is totaled, the police took it to a tow lot which has racked up to about $1000, there is attorneys involved, and its just a big stressful mess. This has REALLY set off his anxiety and depression. Hes paranoid that investigators are watching him, he feels hopeless, hes super anxious, he cannot get out of bed some days, he has obsessive thoughts about WHY his friend would do what hes doing, WHY the people pulled out and t-boned him etc. I am worried the depression will progress and become even more serious. He finally talked to a doctor about it and the doctor prescribed Cymbalta. After doing some reading online, I am scared for him to start it. It sounds like it has some harsh side effects, harsh withdrawals if he comes off of it, hard on the liver (we like to cocktail), and does not seem like a good starter med. I really want him to be on something, but I am worried this is not the best med choice. We attempted to call the doctor to discuss, suggested lexapro or Zoloft, but the receptionist told us that the doctor does not like to be told what to prescribe. It was uncomfortable. Any professional advice would be great. My boyfriend, a car accident, Cymbalta",Depression

16829,"I am sorry in advance for this negative pretentious drivel. This just really needed to come out of me. |||Distrust, disappointment and futile attempts to escape hackdom is all life seems to be.||| 29 years old. I make money as a commercial music producer - music for ads, tv and sometimes amateur film. I am really starting to hate my job. I feel like I am lying to myself when I do it. My family are somewhat encouraging but I know they think I am a fuck up. I spend every bit of time (when I am not trying to calm down my anxiety or pull myself out of depression and when I do not need to crawl out of bouts of procrastination) on music \- playing it, recording it, composing it, listening to it, reading about it. I have always wanted to be able to live off of my own art - but I have always told myself since the beginning (13) that this is a dreamers pursuit and to be realistic - to see what life is really like - and to know that this obsession will lead to nothing but suffering, alienation and potentially a whole lot of humiliation...but.... to do it anyway - because in the meaninglessness of life you should try to at least make it all about what you love. As I get older the idea of getting somewhere... and by somewhere I do not mean for fame or fortune.... but to make something people care about, to do something important in a way of giving back to culture - giving back to the arts that have not only saved my life numerous times, but made me feel exhilaration and love like nothing else has.... this idea of getting somewhere feels less and less likely. The most depressing part is that I do not think I have even properly put myself out there yet, that I would not really know how to --- That I move in so many different directions artistically, that I am so indecisive with what I want that it kind of seems impossible.... AND that this feeling of age is looming on the horizon. Like I am crossing over to 30, with my chances of any of this happening slipping away.Drugs and alcohol have now officially become about coping for me. it is not a party anymore. I hate socialising most of the time, I do not have social problems I am just really tired of it - especially when it is not music related - so I act up, get sarcastic and facetious and use the booze and amphetamines as a way around being irritated by everything and everyone. Which I feel guilty about... ...Because I know this is clearly just me being a miserable, selfish asshole. I cannot stand the incessant opinions of others - I never react to what is being said, I can even ignore it at the time but when I hear some of the shit that comes out of peoples mouths there is always a pain in me that starts and becomes more and more intense over a few hours. It turns into resentment, hate and then crushing sadness. The arrogance, meanness and the seemingly endless conjecture I keep hearing from everyone around me is excruciatingly distressing. I socialise less and less because of this. I live with a few older men - who all at one point tried to do what I want to do. It has not worked out. Now all they seem to have is marijuana, welfare cheques and a cynicism that is so dry, dull and invasive that just by proximity It can make you feel overwhelmingly despondent, dehydrated, hateful and high. there is a bitterness in them that you can feel through the walls of the house. Avoiding conversation is imperative if you want to maintain sanity with these types. Speaking with angry contrarians has never been helpful for mental wellbeing. At least not for me anyway. I have been through 3 long term relationships that all ended badly. The last one was particularly bad. I blame my apathy. Right now I am sort of in a casual relationship with someone who I suspect sees me as an ignorant pig. there is a lot of criticism about a lot of different things thrown in my face by her. Any conversation I bring up about commitment or what the relationship itself is meant to be is dodged. I am really starting to feel like I cannot trust this person. That they see me as disposable. I have already uncovered a few lies by them. Maybe I am wasting my time with a lot of people in my life. Maybe they are wasting their time with me. Every once in a while when I drink I think about killing myself. Every once in a while when I am sober I do as well. Some months way more frequently than others. Some days in those months it is for hours at a time. A few months back, I grabbed some stainless steel scissors and started cutting into my forearm. No one found out what the scars really came from. I had a bad excuse. I am still not sure if it was Just to feel something or to express my frustration in some way. Maybe it was for attention. Cutting myself for attention makes me feel an incredible amount of shame to just think about. But like I say I am not exactly sure why. I do not know where this is going, but I feel like I needed to put this down somewhere.. I have tried a shrink, I have tried family and friends. It seems to only be met with fear. I am sorry again.

18874,"I have been struggling with depression for at least 7 years now and recently got professionally diagnosed by a psychiatrist which was scary and infuriating.This whole year was a shitshow, my grandma who raised me for 1/2 of my childhood died, dad got into the hospital 3 times, my whole family got sick... Moved out from my parents' house and started living alone in the city. We had uni online only and I could not go out much almost all year, there were periods where I did not talk to anyone for weeks. All of my routines went to shit, and when the depression episode hit it lasted more than the usual couple of weeks/1-2 months: 11 fucking months and counting. There were periods where I could not do anything, just self-medicated, cried, or felt nothing for months and tried to distract myself.This is a huge problem since I am in medical school, 2nd year, and have to study a lot. I could compensate for those depressive episodes in high school but not in uni. I hate to admit I have a problem outside of my control so for a long time I was saying to myself that I am a lazy stupid undisciplined bitch and should work harder. So I pushed myself, tried every technique, routine, schedule under the sun, studied all day and it got so much worse. And despite being close to killing myself 2 times in the past, having almost all of the symptoms of depression, I still did not believe I had a mental illness. Because I am so much better than that, right? I am not an emotional person so how could I have a mood disorder. I used to have generalized anxiety and panic disorder from when I was 6 until I was about 17 and got over them by myself, so I thought I can get over this alone too.Only when I started being suicidal, like I did not only not want to live but thought that killing myself eventually is inevitable (since I am never going to become better), really wanted to do it, I thought of asking for help. Called a couple of therapists but they were either unavailable or straight up bailed on me. Cut myself, drank my cool Russian vodka straight from the bottle, smoked a pack of Malboros and decided to suck it up at least after my exams were over. Grandma died a week before the 1st one and I had to console my family, take care of the house and support my mom and dad emotionally. All while trying to cover 260 topics from anatomy in 10 days. For this exam and the next ones, I was way too depressed to study but studied anyway with my 0 energy, 0 concentration, and -100 motivation. Somewhere between the exams I kind of lost it and cut myself again with my pocket knife and it took me 2 days to clean up the mess since I did not have bandages and just made the bathroom and hall look like a murder scene. Slept a lot. My average each semester in the beginning of the depression and before it was all As and now it dropped to a fucking C. So I decided to be stubborn and try to get help again and found a psychiatrist, who had a lot of recommendations and good reviews. Started Zoloft. Since then I am either sleeping, having debilitating migraines or crying because of how helpless I feel. Since the year is over and I am on summer break my friends are calling me to go out, I got asked out on a few dates, I have to start work at the hospital. **I am so fucking angry, man.** it is so hard to make myself do any of this, I am extremely privileged and worked my ass off to be where I am....only to not feel any joy in life and want to disappear. I have parents who love me, I have amazing friends, I got into my first choice medical school to study medicine, I get to live alone, I have so many opportunities in front of me and no ""real"" problems to worry about and yet I am so fucking weak and pathetic that I cannot enjoy any of it. My brain is bad and I do not know why (the only explanation I was given is that my serotonin levels were low, it was a chemical imbalance, etc). I want to be so much better, as a friend, as a daughter, as a doctor in training, but I am what I do and everything I do now is a huge fucking disappointment to everyone. I feel like a fly jamming itself into a window trying to get out. It would be so funny if it was not devastating. All of my personality, ambitions, drive, enthusiasm, energy, pleasure go away because a couple of neurotransmitters are not doing their jobs. And I cannot fix it with hard work, cannot get over it through willpower and telling myself I suck, cannot ignore it. I miss feeling alive and wanting to be. Now I feel like an absence of a person, a puppet to my shitty brain, who is just trying to minimize damage.Wrote this whole thing to avoid cutting myself again since I have no mop. Was forced to tell my father I have depression (over the phone at that), he was shocked, felt bad and was so supportive in the end. Showing any kind of vulnerability, especially in front of my dad, makes me want to break every bone in my body afterward :) Anyway, promised him and myself that I am going to be better and felt so bad about it.

17108,"A little background: I finally found a seasonal job serving a few years back that granted me the most financial security I would ever had. I paid off my debts. I bought a new car. I was planning to save up for a house. I thought I was a good server. I was personable with the guests, always on time, rarely called in, and wanted to work nights. I thought I was valued.Then covid hit and we shut down like everyone else. When things reopened, we had reduced our seating in half, so they did not bring back all the servers yet. The season came and went. I ended up working for a friend at her local business for the rest of the summer and made ends meet through Uber in the winter.As the next season came around, my job brought back all the remaining servers... Except four. Obviously, I was one of them.I called my lead and she explained that she ""could not"" tell me WHY I was not picked to come back. She said I was one of her favorites because I was reliable and worked evenings. Then, as the season got into full swing, there was talk of adding more seats. And then they put up applications for new servers. Some co-workers suggested I reapply, but my thought was, ""they have still got four of us on furlough, they can call us.""They never did. ..Now, I am just bitter. My best friend just posted pictures from her 5-year Pinning Ceremony and I want to be happy for her... But my 5-years should have been in 2020. I was denied what I saw as a career, or at least a means to reach some long-term financial goals. I loved my job. I loved my co-workers. We were a family. And then someone in management decided my future for me. For reasons I never got to know. And now I struggle to tell my best friend ""congratulations,"" when I really feel bitterness instead. And that makes me feel like a horrible person. I just my job and the security of my future thanks to covid.

11987,"Long post incoming. Sorry, it is kind of a cry for help.When I was a kid, I was reading books like a madman. I distinctly remember the time the 6th volume of Harry Potter came out, and I stayed up all night, managing to read the entire thing in one sitting. I am 24 years old now and would absolutely not be able to accomplish such a feat. Years of sitting in front of screens and allowing that dopamine flow have wrecked my attention span. I get easily distracted by the smallest things while reading a book, constantly having to re-read paragraphs, ultimately getting frustrated and putting the book away for ""later"" - and a book that should not take longer than a week, takes me at least a few MONTHS to read.I struggle with studying, too. The entirety of school was easy for me and I did not have to study that much, so naturally I filled that time with video games and the internet instead. Since I was a shy, introverted guy filled with social anxiety who did not really have friends, I had tons of time to waste in front of the computer or the phone. By the time university came, I was in no way prepared and disciplined enough for it, I did not have a work or study ethic. I ended up wasting my time, dropping out of 3 different majors (Chinese studies, law and computer science) because they ended up not feeling right for me, and me lacking the attention span and perseverance to try my best. I still do not have a degree despite being 24. I am starting Sound Design this October, since I have determined that I am interested in music and sound and would like to pursue that as a career, but I fear my lack of focus will because me to fail that as well.Nowadays I am working in an office, where I naturally have to be in front of a computer for 8 hours, then I go back to a lonely home where I am going to sit in front of another computer or my phone until it is time to sleep - day, after day, after day. it is a job which barely pays enough for me to sustain myself, saving up for traveling, which is what I dream of doing, is off the table. I am lonely. I do not have a girlfriend, I do not exercise, I am overweight (not obese though), I barely spend time on any other hobbies. I could be amazing at playing piano and learning Japanese, which are two things that I am interested in, if only I was willing to spend as much time on them as I am spending on video games and watching stupid bullshit on the internet. But my stupid brain refuses to actually focus and I cannot get my shit together. I have tried making a change reducing my screen time a few times, but it always falls apart after a few days tops.I need help. I do not want to be a depressed, lonely underachiever filled with regret for the rest of my days. I am a depressed, lonely, underachieving internet/video game addict with no perspectives.

19855,"I am writing this not knowing if I will ever actually send it; I do not know why I get so anxious when I think of you or make an attempt to reach out. All my thoughts disappear and the only thing I experience is this weird, warm sensation in my chest: there is nothing but a feeling of faintness, like my insides are slowly evaporating. Images flash of what I think your life is like today and I also see memories of other times we have been together. These latter are mostly from moments all our families have been together, I mean the families you have joined with in marriage and our own blood relations. My reflections of the weddings (that I know I was at in the flesh) I experience in the same manner as I envision how your current life is like, as if I am a passive observer, as if I am dead or a ghost. I saw a picture of me at your wedding and I remember feeling so out of place in that world, I recall it now as if I were never there, disconnected and a complete stranger. Sometimes I ask myself if I will ever see you again, I imagine our lives forever separated as if that were the answer but it does not really seem any different than its ever been even when I did appear at various holidays and family gatherings.My life today is just a meager attempt to scrape buy, do the bare minimum just to keep living for what? I do not know. I work by myself and mostly just sit in my truck and read when I should be working. I do not really care. I can get away with it so I do it. I would not say I am depressed, I can get by most of the time without ever having a sad thought: most of my life these days is characterized by indifference. I think about trying to change my life in some way but mostly nothing comes of it, I do not really care. I am just another life amoung millions of others doomed to die in obscurity. Sometimes I see myself as having potential to do great things but then I take revenge on this cruel world by becoming a martyr who will die with this potentiality in my grave. At times I wish I had been born thousands of years ago instead of today. This modern world is grotesque and foreign to me, the paths in life we are limited to tread are dehumanizing. Sure, many people make their own path but I lack the strength and imagination. I do still dream of the perfect life. For me it would be a life of endless travel. There are so many places in the world I would love to visit. But then again I know I am doomed to live my days out in this miserable country, in this pathetic world of an era that cannot even give us the satisfaction of failing so we can create something better. No. I am afraid man is doomed to stagnate forever in the filth of democracy and freedom, mere titles and images while the few toxic hands of corruption really &lt;i&gt;live&lt;i&gt; on the backs of the bodies that suffer in the transcendence of eternal hope.I am rambling but my point is this world is lost to me. I do not have any hope, and without anything to believe in a man cannot be said to exist. I suppose this is why I experience your presence, current and past, as a ghost or as if I have never existed all along and this life is only a dream with my body a mere paroxysm of nerves whose only force is born in the desire to exist.Looking at these words I probably will not send this message. But this is the gulf I so desperately want to bridge but I know my breath is lost in that void so sending it is still the same as not. If I am practically dead already why not make it official? I can never send you these words; how could I? My life is so diametrically opposed to yours. I am afraid I am doomed to live like this. I am deathly afraid. I have no place here.

And from what I can tell, life itself seems meaningless overall. Not to be nihilistic or anything, but I genuinely see no reason to even keep going. Most of the time, I do not feel anything besides ""meh."" or I seem apathetic. I am content being alone, and I am the kind of person who is happy as long as I have any kind of something around me to entertain myself with. As it currently stands, my depression seems to have taken a nosedive. I have not showered in 3 days, because I do not feel like it. We also do not have any hot water, at the moment, and so if I do shower I have to do it in the stupidest way possible and I do not even feel clean afterwards. Basically I was taught when this happens, boil water, mix it with some cool water, pour it in sink, and use a washcloth to wipe yourself down. Stupid, and takes way more effort than a regular shower. And I do not feel like taking a cold shower. And I mean realistically, if I died tomorrow, nobody would notice for a long time. Not even work because I work minimum wage, and they would just assume I would quit or something. My grandparents do not need me. My parents do not care where I am, or what I am doing, they are busy raising my siblings or getting high. it is been like that since I was a baby though. My grandparents would find my body, if I were to die, and probably be sad, but I feel like that is only because of the fact they raised me. They would actually benefit if I was gone, seeing as to how often they complain about how miserable their life currently is. How broke they are, ect. I feel like I do not really exist, except to make them happy, because I am always their emotional support child. They argue and yell all the time. Just this morning, my grandpa decided to start an argument because my grandma grabbed the wrong bowl. She said she wished she had never left my aunts house(She went to visit last week), and my grandpa said he wished she stayed too. Then of course, she comes into my room crying, then she makes my favorite meal, then comes to announce that she made my favorite meal, and then let us herself into my room to make my bed. This stuff is her way of trying to make herself feel better, it is not out of genuine love I do not think. Because if I am in a bad mood, and I do not immediately perk up, it must be her fault and she will start crying even more. there is no escape from the negativity. I have to fake my happiness, obviously, because her feelings depend on mine. I hate it, and there is no escape from the negativity.I mean, I found roommates that hopefully I will be moving out with soon. But even then, I am not sure life will get any better. Because I am pathetic enough, that most people think there is something wrong with me and see me as a walking red flag. I am of course, poor as well, so you know, add that onto it. But I have been saving up my money. I just do not know what to do with any of it. I have been saying I want to go to college, but I have no idea what I want to do with my life. And I do not know why I would go to college yet, I do not want to waste my money on something I might never use or might not even like. There are a lot of people out there who view me as a loser, because I smoke weed, play video games, work, and am not in college. To add onto that, everyone acts like you should strive to ""better yourself""But in my opinion, I am not sure what I should better about myself. Or why. To make it so I am more tolerable to you? Because if I do not see you putting in the same effort, why would I put in all the work so you can freeload? If that makes sense. I mean, I am just here to vent at the moment. But I am not really upset. Or sad, even. I am not sure what I am feeling, but it is neither hopeless nor hopeful. I do not see a reason to keep going",Depression

12114,"Hey there folk, friendly neighborhood rant here. cannot promise it will be reader-friendly in terms of like formatting or timeline, but I will try my best. That being said, here goes.&amp;#x200B;Okay so this whole thing starts when I was about 11, mormon, living in California, and my parents were getting divorced. My mother left me with my father, who was too depressed to even get out of bed, for 2 weeks. She comes back for my sister's wedding, and we move to Indiana. In Indiana, my mother and my other sister (s2) decide that they are going to ""co-parent"" me more or less. S2 is pretty much just unlikable in every way. She is the type of person to gaslight you into thinking you are not depressed (we will get to that). Then, after about a year or two in that living situation, the ""Strawberry Incident"" occurred. This is when S2's mother asked me if I felt like cutting some strawberries, and I replied that I did not. I was then forced to do muscle failure for a week straight. After that occurred, I began to realize that the family I have may not be the best for me. Fast forward to about a year later. My father moves out to live with S2. One day, I was getting back from a temple trip to Indy and I had a confrontation with S2. I told her how I felt and said I was not sorry. I then went to talk to my father and he called me a ""Selfish Cocksucker"". That one always stuck. Flash forward one more year, and I am in 8th grade. I am having trouble mentally and had planned my own offing. I was going to do it the night of a concert for my school band. A teacher ended up finding out and told my mom. She then turned it into me trying to actively harm her. I was then sent to a mental hospital wherein I was sexually assaulted by my roommates. When I get back, S2 tells me that I was not really depressed because she would have known. &amp;#x200B;\-INTERMISSION-Hey there here is a little break from the madness. I hope you are having a good day. Anyways, let us dive back in.\-END OF INTERMISSION-&amp;#x200B;After that, I have a pretty uneventful time up until about the end of my freshman year. I had ended up overdosing on my antidepressants and told my best friend, W. Me and W went into a stairwell and we called the crisis hotline, thinking it would be the last call I make. W and I had planned to sing ""Wonderwall"" in our school's talent show. I had ended up being hospitalized again before being able to preform with him. I still feel terrible. Later on, I was with my mother in a taco bell drive thru, and the only thing I remember her saying is ""Why should I care about you when you treat me the way you do."". After a few weeks, cue a family party. I was on an LGBT site that I used to frequent (I think it was a mightynetwork site, I do not really remember all that well.) and also doing my schoolwork. S2 looks over to see what I was doing, and I showed her my schoolwork. She got suspicious of me, and asked to see my iPad. I refused, not wanting her to find out I was a member of the LGBT. She then escalates it, and we end up outside. I tell her that she is an active contributor to my depression, and she says that I do not have it. The next parts are extremely hazy, but I do remember her pushing me to the ground. I still refuse to give her my iPad password, so she threatens to call the police. In retrospect, I still would have kept it from her. After that, my brother in law ends up getting it from me and looks through my profile, finding out that I was Abrosexual. He then laughs at me, and offers me a cigar and beer to ""cool off"". Fun stuff. So after those events, I just cry myself to sleep and that is that. W ends up moving to the next town's school for our sophomore year and beyond. I have a new confidant, D. D and I go to the school counselor together to try to fix my living situation, and I am eventually told to go to the office one day. My principal, thinking I was in a gay relationship with D, called me a ""sick bastard"", and changes mine and D's schedules, so that we no longer have classes together. Somewhere along that timeline, in my freshman year, my dad dies. I am forced into sitting in a hospice room, awake, with my dying father for 12 hours. Flash forward to now. Going into my senior year. I am scared of letting anything show to my mom and getting hospitalized and not being able to go on my germany trip next year. I just want to know what to do. Please. :,)",Depression

22437,"I really just want to get this off my chest and not be met with the same exact response that my friends and family have. it is not like my situation is particularly worse than anyone else's. I come from a middle class home, have parents that really care about me, and somehow still have friends that care too. I had great grades in middle school and through jalf of high-school with little to no effort being put in on my part, and even had a pretty good amount of friends. But for some reason at around early junior year in high school I just started to feel different. And at the time that was the only way I knew how to explain it. I was simply not feeling like myself. I found myself not doing homework more and more instead of finishing it all in the last 10 min of class like I usually did. I found myself more and more dresding social interaction with everyone, from my friends to my parents to even my gf. It did not start all at once and instead grew steadily over time, and because of that, I think I started to blame my surroundings in search of why I might be acting so differently. I was/am (I do not know about now) a pretty intelligent person in general. Not to say I am better or inately smarter than anyone, but school always came easy to me growing up and because of that I found myself surrounded by some truly brilliant people... that I compared myself to constantly. The thing is that at first it actually served to bolster my confidence a lot. I would see the smartest kid in my grade and my good friend K make a 96 on a test and look at my 90 and think ""wow, I am in the same league as him, I must be smart"". So when I started to make 80's, 70's, or fail the occasional assignment outright, I took it as me failing to be good enough. It made me feel as though they were better than me and that I was simply not as good as them. But I think what really drove my anxious thoughts to a truly unhealthy point was when I started worrying about what they thought of me. I constantly worried about what my friends with near perfect sat scores and literal genius level iq scores thought about me, thinking that if I did not continue to make good grades like them, they would see me as weird or a bad influence or just someone who was undesirable to be around. My intelligence ended up betraying me in the end because I started cheating really really well. I will not go into detail because I am really not proud of it now, but I got really good at cheating. I began cheating on most tests and quizzes and cheating on every homework without fail. It helped keep my head above water through my junior year making all A's and B's which was good enough for my parents (most of the time) and put to rest my anxiety about what my friends thought about me. However, I knew what I was doing and it wore on me. How I could I go from legitimately slaying in the classroom... to this. In short i started to hate myself for what I was doing but saw no way out because it was that or be tormented by the other thoughts. Eventually I snapped and the pressure just made me break. I gave up completely, feeling like a waste of space for letting everyone (including myself) down. I stopped doing assignments all together instead opting to watch YouTube through the 8 hour school day and play video games the second I got home as a way to make the days go by quicker and to chase away of of these thoughts. My parents being the great people they are really tried to make their divorce as non impactful on their parenting as they could, and continued to try things like therapy, anti-depressants, involving other family members, and even letting live with my dad for a time to see if that helped. It did not. I felt the exact same and ended up feeling worse afterwards because I blamed myself that all of their effort went to waste on someone like me. I only managed to graduate because they managed to transfer me to an ""alternative leaning school"" 3 days before covid made the schools shut down nation wide. All this meant was that cheating became 10x easier and faster, leaving more time for video games and YouTube. While all of this was going on, I thought I would be a fantastic idea to get an online girlfriend that lived literally 1,000 miles away that i would not be able to see for at least a year, after talking to her for only a few months. I met her on an online game that we both played through a mutual friend and at first she was great. Funny, smart, quirky, cool, great music taste etc. Basically what I at the time thought to be the whole fucking package. Now we live together in my mom's house and in my time living with her I have grown more attached to her good qualities and painfully aware of her bad ones. She is by no means a bad person but rather a deeply troubled and traumatized girl with so so so much heart... and I can barely handle it. Her past trauma with her alcoholic family including but not limited to being shit faced for the first time at age 12, breaking up fights between her COMPLETELY shifted parents and older sister, her older sister and mother verbally abusing her, her family never taking her to the dentist or doctor etc. Honestly I could go on and to make it worse she survived all of that while defending her younger brother who is 7 years younger than her, from as much as she could by herself. I know, it makes what I am going through seem small but because of her past, she can sometimes be really hard person to live with. She can get really really angry at small things (to the point where she gets in my face and calls me a peice of shit and blocks my exit so I cannot leave), has really bad impulse control and let us her eating and spending get out of control frequently despite very badly wanting to do the opposite, has a pretty hard time taking no for an answer. Break up with her. Right? At least that what I would say to someone if I heard about that. I would say if you are not happy, or getting what you need out of a relationship there is no reason to put yourself through that kind of strain. The thing is, she is a really really sweet person who always manages to make me laugh, always notices when I am not feeling happy, surprises me with little displays of affection, and is almost always willing to come to the table and talk about what is going on and what we can do to fix it. She shares most of my interests and what she is not really that invested in, she learns about anyway and let us me show her and genuinely gives me her full attention when I talk about them. I end up feeling conflicted inside all of the time around her. it is really been wearing on me lately and in the last few months and I just do not know what to do. But wait... there is more! On top of all of that bullshit college is starting soon and I am extremely anxious about messing that up too. I fully understand the importance of college and the effect it can have on your future career and that makes it all the harder on me mentally. I am just tired of feeling like a disappointment and so desperately want to feel like I used to: competent. If you slogged through that word vomit and are reading this now all I have to say is thank you. Any advice or kind words are welcome but not necessary at all. Tldr: I made some really poor choices and feel too anxious and depressed to do anything about it. Made this account so my gf would not see this post. Just a sad story with a lot of self pity thrown in. (This going to be a really long post and I am sorry)",Depression

I was slightly worried that it might not have been a dream, but thought there was no way he would ever do something like that.For some background: He had tried to stick his hands down my pants numerous times one night, doing it successfully once and fondling me. I did not talk to him for a year and told him when I got back in contact with him how much it messed me up, and that if he ever did anything like that again Id never speak to him. He promised me he would not.Today I was messaging him and told him that I got a new girlfriend, and he made a comment saying that he wishes he could have blown me again. I asked him what the fuck he was talking about, and he said nothing I guess... and we conversed a bit more and he said that he sucked my dick when we were both drunk.I genuinely thought it was just a vivid nightmare, but it was not.

47869,"Felt lost today so wrote this out of nowhere, I’m not a writer at all. Just wanted to share 
Fear and anxiety rule his every thought , loneliness and despair fill every breath in his lungs. 

Darkness reigns unchallenged, the light is all gone. Feelings of happiness extinguished and drowned, deluge of pain and suffering watered them down. 

Like an ancient warrior facing certain death, wounded , bruised and bleeding he marches on. 

Flashes of memories that are long gone, hints of an era that once had begun. With fire and passion his heart once fought. Stabbed and damaged it won’t pump blood , only anger rage flow thru the holes. 

For his Queen he swore once that death he would take. Just to protect her from the evils out there. But no one had warned him of the evil within. A festering wound that ends in gangrene . Rotting soul and heart but not too fast. Ensuring he suffers as much as he can.

The dream of a life was just a mirage . Leading the warrior into an inescapable trap. Battle after battle, war after war. Trenches of anguish is where he stands. 

What was the purpose the man thought to himself. Looking around for someone to help. No one in sight to hear his plight, only more darkness and none of the light. 

Hopeless and tired he kneels on his sword. With honor and valor he lets it all go. Plunging the steel makes the flesh cold. Followed by warmth of the pouring hot blood.  

Seconds feel like years as life flashes by. He enjoys every memory with his last ever smile. 

But out of the darkness someone reached out . Returning the light and the life that ran out. 

The warrior perplexed looked almost scared , for he had never encountered no one that cared. 

His story unfinished and with no clear path. But now he’s determined to let go of the past. 

Wounds that are healing wounds that will come. Master the pain that will never be gone.

No matter how close or how far. He will continue to battle this war.",Depression

48062,"Our most-broken and least-understood rules is ""helpers may not invite private contact as a first resort"", so we've made a new wiki to explain it We understand that most people who reply immediately to an OP with an invitation to talk privately  mean only to help, but this type of response usually leads to either disappointment or disaster.  it usually works out quite differently here than when you say ""PM me anytime"" in a casual social context.  

We have huge admiration and appreciation for the goodwill and good citizenship of so many of you who support others here and flag inappropriate content - even more so because we know that so many of you are struggling yourselves.  We're hard at work behind the scenes on more information and resources to make it easier to give and get quality help here - this is just a small start.  

Our new wiki page explains in detail why it's much better to respond in public comments, at least until you've gotten to know someone.  It will be maintained at /r/depression/wiki/private_contact, and the full text of the current version is below.

*****

###Summary###

**Anyone who, while acting as a helper, invites or accepts private contact (I.e. PMs, chat, or any kind of offsite communication) early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement.  Either way, it's unwise to trust them.** 


""PM me anytime"" seems like a kind and generous offer. And it might be perfectly well-meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it's just not a wise idea.  Here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately.

* **By posting supportive replies publicly, you'll help more people than just the OP. If your responses are of good quality, you'll educate and inspire other helpers.** [The 1-9-90 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture\)) applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.  

* People who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need. **Unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good.** This is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don't give their names and callers aren't allowed to request specific responders.  It's much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole.  Analogously, it's much safer and healthier for our OPs to develop a relationship with the community as a whole.  Even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone.  It's partly about availability, but it's mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue. 

* **If a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a PM conversation it's much harder for others, including the /r/depression and /r/SuicideWatch moderators to help**.  (Contrary to common assumptions, moderators can't see or police PMs.)  

* In our observation over many years, the people who say ""PM me"" the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental-health issues and mental-health support. We all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively.  Community input mitigates these limitations. **There's no reason why someone who's truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny**.  If helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that self-disclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of alt/throwaway accounts, and have no restrictions on account age or karma.  

*  We all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others.  These people *do* want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims. There are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mental-health issues. **If a helper invites an OP to talk privately and gives them a good, supportive experience, they've primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers.** This sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someone's in a state of mental-health crisis, when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning.

* If OPs want to talk privately, posting on a wide-open anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option. Although we don't recommend it, we do allow OPs to request private contact when asking for support. If you want to do this, please keep your expectations realistic, and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to PM before opening up to them.",Depression

My immediate family who I live with were made aware of this by me after I admitted to them I had felt suicidal this was near the end of 2019.Fast-forward to now and although I spend most of my time with my immediate family which helps me out I still suffer strongly from loneliness as I only have one friend who tends to be busy, but we hang out occasionally.I have a deep desire for a deep and meaningful connection, someone I can call a close friend who I can trust, and also a partner I can spend time with.This loneliness is emotionally damaging to me as I am seeing an abundance of content online on TV, YouTube, etc., where people are happy with their friends and/or partners, and here I am wanting someone to call a friend or partner, to be happy.I am trying to meet new people but I cannot find any meet-up groups of young people like myself who share my interests. I will not open up to my family due to feeling a sense of being pathetic, embarrassed for my lack of social life, and because I do not want their pity or to be treated differently.I just feel stuck and hopeless now, and this drives my thoughts of suicide and misery.All I want is someone to talk to that is not my family, but I also feel like my feelings are not valid because I have not tried everything. Loneliness is emotionally painful",Depression
10255,"Grew up in an abusive household, constantly yelled, belittled, gaslit, hit, bullied all my life. I cannot remember the last time my eyes were not watery. I finally got out of an extremely abusive friendship with a narcissist, but i think he was a sociopath. I have been going through the motions, letting out all these feeling that i never acted on and ignored. And seeing things for the 1st time for what they really were. Since then, I have broken my bathroom window, almost cutting my knuckle off. A week later, i started hyperventilating to where i could not brreath. That was an interesting feeling. And then i went into a blind irrational stasis of sorts, idk what to call it and juat cut 13 lines in my arm. Kind of like a blind rage but not. I try to hide it but sometimes it gets seen and everyone just gives a judgy glare. I later went into a blind rage having flashbacks and broke the window in my car.

47841,"Need help Hi, 

So I really need some help/pointers in where  I go wrong or what I can do do fix mu current life. 

* Short info: 
* Fucked a girl who got pregant and kept the kid. (I iniciaded the  child custody court) (ugly court battle) 
* My son is 3 years.  Lives 50/50 with his mother and me. 
* High performing job, future is looking bright but I work 50-60 hours weeks.
   * When  I or my son get sick the backlog of work is INSANE.
   * Work is now taking some seriously battles in my head, like I dont really know how long I will be able to keep this job going. To much to do, there is no way ever that anyone will be able to do this job
   * Im a people pleasere so I fuck my own schedule on a daily basis at work.
* Poor as fuck, all money went to court, batteling bill to bill now. (wife didnt have to pay since she is on welfare and then the ""tax-payers"" are paying for her court.
* Creditcard debt of $1300 but I cannot pay anything on it, all money goes to bills and my son.
* Car loan debt $10.000, cant sell car since I travel 1 hour each way to get my son from daycare or his mother. 
* Renting the my current appartment. 
* I might be able to save around 100-200$/month if Im lucky.

I feel that my life is just fucked, completely and utterly fucked and I cannot for the life of me see any light anymore. I was so happy before, life was so good before kids, court a maniac mother to my kid. 

I just long so much for the old day and I cannot for the life of me ""enjoy"" the current times.   


Spoken to a couple of therapists but I don't know, they are quite fast to add diagnises without doing any tests...   


My dream now is to just run my car as fast as I can into a wall to make all the pain stop, I tought life was hard. But I had no idea how utterly awfully painfull this existence is.   
Like I run that scenario through my mnd at least 100 times a day and I just long for it. 

Of course I wont do it, I have a son etc. But I really just wished that a car could crash into me, kill me on the spot etc.   
I always thougth I was a strong man. But im a weak one.... Well....

I try to remidate the feelings with friends, loved ones, loads women, working out etc.   
But nothing feels ""good"" or satisfying. Nothing currently feels satisfying.   
My schedule looks something like this:   


05.00 (I or son wake up)   
08.00 Son at day care  
09.00 Back home   
09.00 - 15.00 Work   
15.15 - go get son at day care  
16.16 - home.   
16.30-20.00 Time with son, food playing, goofing around etc. 

20.00-24.00 (8pm-12 pm) Work  


Those days where my son is not at my palce:   
I tend to get 1,5 hours traning in per day.   
Good foods and some rest in between aswell. 

But something like this, weekends looks the same

05-06 wake up  
08.00 - 18.00 (8 am to 6 pm) work   
18-20 sparetime  
20.00 to 24 work  

Working out has always helped. But only for the short time when Im in the gym.   
I dont do any drugs, Alcohol is not my thing, plus I got LOADS of alcoholism in my family so I dont want to go the same way there...

22939,"I have been thinking tonight and i think i had anxiety for more than i can think of. in first 2 years of uni and last year of high school i had a friend whom was anxious and he kind of gave his vibe to me, i panic a lot over small stuff. still it was worse when he was around and since i have not seen him i feel better but, maybe he induces my anxiety, other than that my mom does the same since she probably has anxiety issues but also depressed and taking depression pills. i do not know, i remember in first grade i sat down alone and just felt alone and dissatisfied, this feeling of dissatisfaction still continues till today. i had that feeling of loneliness maybe till 5th grade and then anxiety replaced it? i always feel i cannot trust people, nor they can trust me and i feel worthless. maybe its a relationship issue? i remember in kindergarten there was a girl that we liked each other but after that i moved out of that city.i feel lack of self-esteem and motivation, for last 4 years or so i have not done anything really, i guess i was more active in 7th grade(13yo) but it gradually went down till 12th where this guy came up and started his nihilistic crap and laziness and it felt like a hit on a nail and i failed 2 studies that year, me whom was acing before.was it puberty that messed me up? I am 22 now but i never had any relationship in my life, i was straight till 18, then anted to make my options more so i did not really care about gender till 20 but then again i feel i cannot get that emotional attachment to a same sex person. speaking of emotions i think i have emotional pain, sometimes my body, my chest and wrists hurt alot and i cry in my bed, i think i have this since when i was 13.i do not have much hope on stuff, things feel a bit numb, my studies are not going well and in last 2 semesters (thanks to covid) i have not seen many people and i did not study anything, but there were some friends around and we cheated the exams, which i personally have issue with. first semester i dropped a class because the guy gave points to everyone but i wanted to learn the topic so i dropped but now i just feel indifferent, i want to do stuff but i feel i cannot, i feel weak and not in control of my life, i feel i cannot stand for myself and get to anything that i ever want and if i want to do it, something will eventually go wrong and make me to lose. i feel failure is always there and its not a bad thing that happens and makes me sad, its just a part of everything i have or dream of, i guess i cannot achieve anything. i wanted to lose my weight for so long but anxiety made it just worse. i have lost much time that i cannot spend to experience and find stuff that i want i guess, or get skillfulled in two or three skills that i really want and i should just pass on. i failed my uni entrance exam in order to go to a good uni and went to a more normal one which i did not like, and i wanted to change it 3 times and the idea never left me and i still have nightmares about it, i tried to face and do it again but was just looking at an escape because it all was painful and was hurting me even more and someone told me to drop it, so i did stop taking re-entrance exam.i do not know what is wrong with me, i went to therapist 2 times but i could really speak since i just do not know.since this is too long i guess no one will even comment on this, huh i would not be amazed what is wrong with me?",Depression

21798,"Hello, I have (22F) struggled with my mental health since I was very young, I was bullied when I was a kid and developed social anxiety because of it. Then I became depressed in my teenage years, but got better when I was 20.I have never been good at interacting with people, due to my anxiety I find it really hard to talk spontaneously to people, but at the same time I can get defensive over anything, like I feel people are attacking me or trying to make fun of me but in reality they are just joking around. A lot of people do not like me because of that, I seem really mean but I am not, I wish I could be friends with people like a normal person but I just cannot. Lately I have been having good days and bad days, but exaggerated. When I am having a good day I feel amazing, I am productive and do a lot of things. But in my bad days I feel way too bad, I was clean (from self harm) for 4 years and I did it again like a week ago. When I feel bad I also cannot stop thinking I want to die, I feel like no one will ever like me, Ill never get a job because I run away from good opportunities because of my anxiety. I just want to disappear but I do not want to kill myself because I do not want my family to suffer. TL;DR: I do not know if I am depressed or not, I have motivation a lot of days but some days I become suicidal and I think its all because of my anxiety I can feel happy some days and other days I want to die",Depression
21189,"Currently I am 25 and I am working in a bookstore, I started 3 years ago after leaving university. I like my job but the start was rough. So right now, I still live in the same house as my parents but a separate apartment in it. And the older I get, the more I realize that my parents are far from perfect and a lot of issues I have with my mental health come from their behavior. I have a very small family, only my parents and two grandma's with dementia. Long story short, my parentd are very protective of me, so a lot for me and almost always at home a d talking to me. Because of that, I have no skills, no ambition, no self esteem, no privacy. I want to move out anf maybe move far away, maybe even change jobs and become something else because working I retail is bad for my anxiety.And here is the problem when ever I tell people this, they ask me, well no problem, you will learn to live on your own and what do you love to do, that is your next job! Think is, I hab eno passions. I never learned to fight for something, instead I give everything up. Because bullying I have a hard time making friends, let alone keeping friendships. All three friends I have rn are living far away. I have no job or career path that sounds like fun to me. I am not made to work the same shit 40 hrs a week. there is nothing I want to do. Besides that, I have no experience in life because my parents do everything for me, I am afraid that if I move out I would call them 5 times a day, either because I need help or because I feel bad for leaving them. My life has nur purpose or sense. I am turning more and more into the person that normal people make fun of. I am joking ill be a weird cat lady when I am older but it is less and less funny. I am pathetic. And if I ask older people for advice all they say is that it will get better once I move put and that I can still find my passion and my I dependency, which helps me not at all. I am not even asking for help here because I feel like I am a person that cannot be helped. I am not made for life. I need to get this off my chest because I cannot tell this anyone in person.

11050,"Hey guys - I am 32M, and have had pretty severe depression and anxiety for many years now. When I think about it, I think it all started with my mother's death when I was a child, but for many years I buried everything, I got on with life, did not complain, went to school, went to work, did ok in life. But somewhere around the age of 21 I just cracked, I started having sleep problems, I felt anxious and depressed and even had nightmares about my mother a lot and I just could not function. But instead of seeking help I tried to just march on with life, as I had done before, but this time I was not able to. Things got worse, I was isolated, did not respond to messages/calls from people I knew, became more isolated and tried to commit suicide. I wish I had known that I was genuinely depressed. As strange as it sounds I had no idea what was going on with me. Not a single person noticed in my life, they were terrible with things like mental health etc. Not an ounce of support or understanding, just a tacit understanding that I should not talk about anything like this.I spent a period of 2-3 years pretty much bed ridden, even more isolated, lonely, health failing, mind crumbling. But with therapy and medication managed to crawl out of that hole. It has been 10 years now, 10 years of struggle and I still cannot believe it has been that long. I have been destitute, alone, isolated, homeless for a period, jobless for long stretches. Basically just so unwell that I was not able to ever plan for anything, or get my life back together. I was taking it an hour or a day at a time. There were days when just brushing my teeth was an achievement. But how could I explain this to someone? I could barely look after myself.I managed to start medication and get therapy and that was a huge help, and for the past 3 years or so I have been doing ok, but there are still moments when the pain I carry from those difficult years are hard to shake off. I thought I had friends, I thought I had family, but when the time came I was truly alone. Not a single person really helped me, and that broke my heart and changed many of my relationships. I do not feel the same, even though I still see some of these individuals...Anyway, long story short, I think I am doing ok now, but at times it really gets me down when I think of all the time I have lost, I know there is nothing I can do about it, and on better days I tell myself just to carry on and it will be ok. I try not to compare myself to friends or anyone else, but at times I look around and see people I know, people who were at one stage the same as me, and they are doing great in terms of career and relationships, and I am truly happy for them, but I see myself and it really crushes me. It dawns on me how truly sick I was and how much time I have lost, and it is hard to get myself out of that hole. I feel like I still struggle a lot and it has cost me relationships/friendships and also financially/career-wise. I look healthy, I am tall, have hair, in very good shape, but I cannot seem to tell anyone, a few times I have tried but how do you open up with such heavy stuff. Family members have just dismissed me, and acquaintances sometimes cannot believe me because they say I look like I am well. But deep inside, there are days and weeks where I feel such pain that I do not know if I can carry on.I do not know why I am posting this today, I have had an ok week, but this morning I woke up and just felt terrible. I am still on medication and yesterday picked up some more from the pharmacy. The only thing is because I take generic sertraline sometimes the brands change, I do not know if my mood has anything to do with the fact that I started taking another brand of sertraline the other day...but I just feel so low right now, have not felt like this in months, I feel like killing myself, it is a horrible soul-crushing feeling and I feel like I should hang myself to just stop feeling this. It just crept up on me all of a sudden. I know this sounds a bit negative but I just needed to reach out and talk to some fellow human beings, and just be heard and listened to, I do not have anyone I can tell and I feel like I am drowning right now. I feel such profound pain it is almost making me cry, which never happens. Like my mood is just out of whack and cannot be controlled.Please, anyone, help, suggest something or just say you hear me and that I am not alone. I really need to just talk to someone, or to be heard. Having a really bad day.",Depression

I try to force myself into hobbies for something to do and busy my mind but I cannot focus because nothing is enjoyable. I cannot even meet peers with like interests because I have no interests. I could sit still staring at an empty wall for hours, I have anxiety over everything in my life. I get told to shut up by multiple people daily because when I am nervous I make puns about everything . I wish I had an off switch so I could turn everything off and not have think or do anything. I feel empty and broken and have no meaning in my life other than supplying for other peoples needs. I do not even know who I am because I spend so much time worrying about others needs I do not even allow myself to think of anything I may want or need because Ill never be able to do those things anyway nor would I like said metaphorical things anyway.

15019,"Once in a while, I go on Instagram/Snapchat. I see a bunch of my (irl) friends re-posting things like ""this user is depressed"" and a ton of other depression/mental illness related posts on their public stories. Some of them post monthly ""mood reports"". The happiness level is always very low, and the anxiety level is up there. I really try not to, but a part of me thinks they are faking it. Though I obviously should not jump to conclusions so fast. there is also a part of me that believes them, and I cannot help but envy them for their confidence. How can they post things like that for everyone to see, when I give it my all to hide how I am feeling every day? I can just imagine the other viewers replying to their stories like ""Are you doing alright? I am here to talk."" and frankly, that makes me so envious and and longing for someone, anyone other than strangers on this app to talk to. It makes me sick to my stomach and I hate it, because I know I am being extremely selfish when I think about the way I am probably suffering just as much as they are, but they have support and I do not. I do not have anyone to lean on. I have not told a single person since the day I started feeling this way. I wish I could just muster up the courage to tell a family member or a friend.

I did not know that I was delusional at the time. After few weeks of meeting her I started feeling that she is my mom. But she did not know. I kept it a secret. But eventually I told her about it. After few years I started feeling that she is my real mom. I love her a lot, I want her in my life. I feel depressed because I cannot meet her anymore. Can your therapist be continue to be in your life on compassionate grounds? I feel depressed without her. I wish I was not delusional when I first met her. She helped me change my life.

Overall I feel significantly less depressed right now, after over a week of full on black dog mode. Highly recommend giving it a look.

23915,"Still live with my parents, still a minor yeah. Not for long though, wish I could cherish my youth for what its worth since I never really got to get out of the house much or have anything closely resembling a healthy functioning friendship. Just overcontrolling and overbearing parents with shit abusive colleagues. Parents left for a business trip, 'bout a week. Two days ago, was melding over my dwindling sanity and the increasing gaps in my memory. I cannot remember shit about any traumatic events I may or may not have had in the past, so it is quite depressing to think that maybe they just never happened in the first place. I have no real reason to be depressed so it is quite likely that I am just doing all of this for the attention. At least that is what I have been told. Cracked out alcohol, since I cannot cry. have not been able to cry for a very long while. Parents used to beat me for crying, colleagues used to beat me as well. School when I was younger was shit, used to get beaten up a lot. Broke my nose twice, a few other bones in my body. Belittled and broken down so fucking much it bled straight through to the point where I had a decent sized portion of my adolescence where I was obsessed with the idea of transitioning to abandon my entire previous personality and set of memories since I could not cope with them anymore. Still fucks me over to this day, and although I might have found a balance for a ""softer guy"" type personality it still does not play well at times. Right, sidetracking. Alcohol. Thought it might help me unbottle some emotion to the point where it overflowed and I might cry again. have not eaten anything proper for months now, usually just half a meal a day, (Think a sandwich, maybe two on a good day), so the alcohol kicked in really quickly. Sisters were going to be back so I counteracted with around 7-8 espressos in a large mug. Looking back that was probably a bad idea. I never got around to crying. Instead, sitting on bathroom tile for hours on end, I just took more and more aspirin with ibuprofen to get around to finally biting the dust. I have been trying for *years* now, it just never really worked out since the probability of a proper death and not just oh-great-i-fucking-survived-and-now-my-parents-are-going to-ship-me-to-a-monastary type lifestyle, but then I just could not give less of a fuck. Necked down 6-7 aspirin and 25 ibuprofen when a really bad habit kicked in. I tend to cut myself. Right around my thigh, so that it is easier to hide. Usually I just cut once twice, never revisiting the same wound but goddamn this time I was persistent. Cut the same area multiple times till I hit the femoral artery. Alcohol, ib, aspirin, and caffeine make for one hell of a whack combo, and then I was bleeding out to death as well. Over the course of the next few hours I proceeded to loose a lot of blood. Funny how the only time I am ever smart and live up to the expectations others have of me is when I am trying to kill myself. I have no idea how much, but I had a really fucking bad fever, tremors, and a few others but I have no idea what happened after I got in bed. Bled through the damn mattress, and the only thing that saved my life was a belt and some salt. Strapped it so tightly around my leg I have no idea why I stopped the bleeding, I do not remember 80% of the shit that happened two days ago, as usual, but the thing that was the scariest was the relentless sense of loneliness. it is why I am here now, two days later. Alone in a dark room, desperately calling every number in the contact book to see if someone will pick up, someone to save me from the same nightmare, but no one is there. I am all alone. I know I deserve it, but it is still scary. After all this time, years on end of loneliness I still cannot get over it. I would say I am a kid at heart but after the things I have done in the past the guilt just will not let go. All I know is that life is fucking scary, man. I apologize for the mega-condensed version of this. Yes this is on a new account, I do not want people in my personal life knowing what the fuck is going on. If I managed to do one thing right, it was hide this whole fucked incident from my sisters and brother-in-law without them guessing what the fuck was going on. I did not touch on some of the finer stuff but I suppose that is to be clarified later. I also know there is a decent chance this will get removed, to which I tell the moderators that it is pretty understandable. Whatever happens typing this out helped me a little at least.

27049,"My boyfriend of a year just broke up with me a few days ago. He has depression and I pushed him away. I did and said everything wrong. A few months ago he had a large depressive episode. He did not want to hurt or burden me, so he tried to break up with me to isolate from everybody. I told him I will not let him be alone. I stayed and emotionally supported him, and he was happy I cared to stay.I did not realize that my daddy issues surfaced in the relationship. I needed healing for my inner child regarding insecurities and feelings of being worthy. When these needs were not met, I kept pushing him away, complaining, fighting, criticizing him.My bf tried to fix me, he felt guilty that he could not. He tried to heal me, lift my confidence up, he was like my therapist a lot of times. He tried so hard to make me happy by actions not words. I did not appreciate this. All my stupid mind wanted to hear was words from him because that was my mental issue I needed fixing. Nothing he did was enough for me, I desperately acted out every time he did not reassure me. I told the poor guy that he was hurting me and I could not take it. I blamed him that he did not do enough,and he was crushed. He loved me so much he stayed longer than he should have. He said he hung on by a thread for a while but could not take it. The past few months he felt guilty he hurt me. He also took a while to break up with me because he did not want to hurt me and break my heart. He said were not compatible, which I know is untrue because we would be perfect if I had worked on my issues, we are like best friends. He said I should find someone to love me right because he clearly failed. Now he is so stressed out with his job and his health, he is crumbling into pieces that he almost died. He broke up with me last week and told me to take some time to heal myself. I begged him not to break up for a while and he held on but now he begged me to let him go. He said hell still be here for me but as a friend and that he cares about me a lot. We are not talking right now. I feel tremendous guilt. He is at his lowest right now. I am going into therapy to fix my issues. How do I fix this ? I will clearly not try to win him back right now, but I want to be supporting him. Should I do no contact for a month and then reach out and ask how hes doing? How do I reconnect and support him emotionally?

Rotted goop. I do not have a purpose in life, I have no dreams in life, I am wasting away the prime of my life. I dive into my eating disorder to cope and get high sometimes and self-harm. Therapy for me of 3 years failed and my therapist took an indefinite leave so that went down the drain. My psychiatrist is cool but I have tried 15+ meds and nothing really works. I cannot figure out this big issue in my life and I repeatedly obsess and ruminate over it with no answers or solutions as I sit paralyzed in fear. I think I just realized today that my depression has been getting worse in ways I did not recognize as I have gone up on this new medication. Talking to people has become more of a chore than it used to be. It gets on my nerves to have to speak up or when anyone talks to me. I do not care to talk about anything I am interested in anymore. I used to at least have some interest in certain topics, but now I just do not care and I do not want to talk to anyone. Every word said to me or that I say is a fork on a chalkboard. I have to psych myself up to raise my voice and speak. I do not care about doing things I used to do with friends. Well, I care less, anyway. Or more like I am just indifferent. Numbed out... I still care. But it does not feel as...there? It feels like I am wearing emotion-canceling headphones. it is all still there, but it is so muted. I cannot stay awake during the day at work at all. Worse now than before. I find myself seeming to play less with my wonderful pets...I have lost credibility at work and plateaued with my ability. And I just do not care anymore. It makes me feel bad but I do not care enough to do anything about it at all. I realize I suck at my work but so what. I have already failed, I still fail. So what... My motivation was already shit but now it is more like I do not care... I used to be upset that my motivation was gone, angry about it, in a sense? And now I kind of just do not give a shit. I recognize that my motivation is still gone and sure it is still upsetting but not as upsetting as it was because I do not feel the anger at myself as much. Occasionally I have bursts of extreme emotion, like yesterday I had a MAJOR anger rage moment where I had to take anti anxiety meds to even remotely start to calm down after a period of screaming, slamming things around and knocking things over and self-harming viciously in a frenzy. Some days I burst into tears for all night and just keep a rag with me to soak up the tears as the time passes and I try to do things that fall within my normal schedule and small range of activities I do once I go home from work. Every day is a repeat of the day before. Week by week. All the same. it is Monday, then suddenly Friday. Then the weekend. Then Monday...repeat. I do not care about any of it. Monday, Wednesday, Sunday...whatever. All the same. The best part of my day is when I get to come home from work and have a binge and purge episode for like 2-3 hours. that is literally the most I look forward to. And even that is starting to fade out. Everything is faded. Everything is muted. At random times I explode, but then the monotony sets back in and I find myself almost in a stupor of some kind. My life is meaningless and I want it to be over. I do not want to commit suicide, I just want to not exist. I do not want to kill myself, I just do not want to exist",Depression

21480,"I have been abused most of my life. Sexual abuse from a young age, emotional abuse as well. Mental abuse, though less frequent, and also, lately financial abuse. I am 33. I have never stopped living for my parents. I have had few friends, and none that lasted. I have had no relationships. I am isolated and afraid. I do not think I am going to last much longer like this, without falling apart. I have been depressed since I learned what sexual abuse was. it is isolating, to hear someone prattle on about something you know from experience, and warn against it like you have a choice about whether to be abused. To look around the room, and see frightened, amused, or curious faces, but not see anyone else looking around. No one else that might be wondering if they are the only ones that already experienced this. I do not want to get into my bad behaviors, just know they are destructive and ruining my life. And escalating. I feel like there is a part of me that is trying to break free, and it is dangerous. it is caused very dangerous situations in my life. it is all been so much worse, since last year. My mom died, and despite everything, I still loved her. I was the only one present when she died. I saw her face, and watched life leave her eyes. I am haunted to this day by that picture. Is there anything I can do? I am so scared and alone. I try to talk to people, and it always ends horribly. Nobody can understand me, or if they do, all they have is pity. I bring everyone down. I just want to be ok again. I miss having dreams for the future. Right now, my only dream is that there is an end to the suffering.

13150,"tw// eating disorder? not sure if it is or if the tw is needed but just in caseI think this will be all over the place as I am still not sure if it makes sense and am just wrapping my head around it, but I will try. Okay, so I always loved eating, it was a big source of comfort and joy ever since I was a kid (20s now). When I was 18 or 19 (when I started college and started spending more time with my peers as I moved into a new city) I started realizing that I might have an unhealthy relationship with food, as I was binge eating on the daily basis and just started seeing that people around me do not consume the food the way I do, like for example they would stop eating when full. By that point I had always just assumed that everyone ate enormous quantities of food and that it is normal for food to play such a crucial role in ones life.I was also and still am heavily depressed throughout all these years and around the time the first lockdowns were happening last year (early 2020) I realized I was getting high so I can eat more/open up my apatite. I know that it probably started way earlier (I started smoking when I was a freshmen in HS) but that is the first time I noticed the direct link. I mostly eat junk food, such as hamburgers, chips, ice cream basically all the crap you can think of. At some point I ate melted chocolate and canned cream for breakfast. I am pretty sure I gained 60 or 65lbs since I left my hometown which then in return directly makes my depression even worse. So I have been feeling like I am trapped in a vicious cycle for a while now.A couple of months ago I started having days, sometimes multiple in a row, where I would not eat at all or crave any food. I would just feel nauseous by the mere thought of eating anything. There are still days when I binge eat but I feel disgusted and nauseous by the food and the act itself while it is happening whereas before I enjoyed it. Even when I am having a regular-sized meal I sometimes feel disgusted. I was walking around the supermarket today and realized I had not eaten anything in 2 days and that I have no cravings whatsoever. So, I do not know where to go from here? Is this a good thing, that I am disgusted by binge eating (I still do it tho)? Is the feeling of nausea coming from the junk food or is this an eating problem or am I just getting older and not being able to eat as much as I used to and the crap I used to? I know the obvious answer is seek professional help but I would like to hear any thoughts or advice that you might have as I am not even sure what is happening.To anyone that has taken their time to read this, thank you I am disgusted by food",Depression

I was in denial about my depression for a long time but one day sought help and finally started medication and seeing a psychiatrist for it in 2015. I have been on Wellbutrin every since and frankly that alone saved my life. I also take Concerta as needed during the work week to help me focus and have been on that forever. Over the years I have experienced depression slumps where it was like the Wellbutrin was not working as well and was experiencing more frequent anxiety attacks and was put on lexapro with wellbutrin. I was on that combo for about 2 years and noticed i lost all interest in everything I used to love before. It was nice to not feel anxious but it was not nice to not feel anything else. Back to just wellbutrin and also back to experiencing panic attacks and daily spiraling thoughts and questions that I could not answer about why and how could I still be depressed? I workout, eat healthy, have a loving family, have friends, love my job, graduated college and yet still feel as if I have an anchor pulling me down physically, emotionally and mentally. After many talks with my doctor I am now on Prozac and Wellbutrin and had found a great balance and felt almost normal for a long time up until recently.

16102,"it is a terrible idea for one diagnose oneself, or anyone else, with any kind of mental illness.But what do you do when you see someone exhibiting patterns that share many similiarities of a particular condition?In my opinion,My dad is an extremely high-functioning autist.My mother has abandonment issues manifested through codependency and overprotectiveness.My older brother developed a plethora of rituals, that haunt him day by day. Cleanliness addiction to the point of circumcising late, and then developing a trauma from it.My sister has an oppositional defiant disorder, but last night, her entire defense mechanisms broke down from alcohol poisoning, to a point where she was attempting to drown herself.I have had two full-blown manic attacks, both of which ended with a baker act (law enforcement committed me to mental health institutions), and one of them ended in a suicide attempt, to which I simply cannot rationalize how the loaded, cocked, and safety-off gun did not fire. I do not want to rationalize it either.we are a family of Puertoricans.If anyone here knows how latino families work, parents disable their children, by doing everything *for* them, with the genuine intention of protection.I am 24 now, I am still watching my high highs, and my low lows, but as life kept rapid-firing responsabilities, and difficult obstacles to develop my craft/career, it is been a little hard to reflect upon everything.Ever since Covid started/2nd manic attack, I have been forcing myself out of my antisocial tendencies, and at the very least, have conversed extensively with my mother.My mother, coming from a small, family infested town of San Lorenzo, was always very knowledgeable of our genealogy. From her side, and from my dad's side, who also grew up in the same town.Her memory, understanding, and reasoning of our family, and quite distant ancestry, has been key to our slow, but gradual recovery.We have genes from generations of undiagnosed conditions.I want to emphasize just how important my family's hometown is to the story.Everybody knew what everybody was doing in Puerto Rico, more so in the small, rural town of San Lorenzo.it is a humid, hot tropical island with the consistent blessing of constant breeze, thanks to all the mountains.This meant that *everybody*was outside at all times.Specifically in my hometown, everyone knew each other's first and last names, their families, profession, interests... But what everyone was always in a high-alert lookout for was... what people were fucked in the head.Social class was absolutely paramount, and equivalent to success in the 20th century. But in San Lorenzo... your entire life was determined by your the image of your status. Even more so than the status itself.Who your friends could be, what jobs would become accessible, the way people would look at you, and even how your family spoke to you.Gossip spread faster than wildfire.My ancestors suffered traumas from the military. And whether or not they were willing, or even begging, to seek professional help, such weakness would tarnish the image of our name.After I loaded, cocked, and pulled the trigger on my head...That was rock-bottom.Nothing is worse than nothing.I have set myself to make ammends, and rebuild my broken family.It is tough. I am 24. I have dreams and aspirations to use my animations and break into the gaming industry.One way or another.However, the story I want to tell through my games can only written once I understand my own.I love my family.More than anything. They are the reason I am here. They are the drive behind my actions. But they are just as busy trying to find purpose in their own lives, as they are trying to rationalize their difficulties.I am content with this fate. I am happy to be here, to be alive, to know everything I know, and attempt to leave footprint of unconditional love wherever I go.But I do not have anyone to talk to.I do not want to talk about my family issues, or my mental state...But about the games they play. About books they have read.About shows they love.About their top 100 artists.About that bitch customer who just refused to leave without their change.About strategies to overcome my fear of lizards.About day-dreaming of pulling a popshuvit, even though I am terrified of falling from just walking.About how the fuck do analog clocks even work?it is all I really need, man.

17137,"So I have always been a pretty even tempered person, but as time goes on I feel like I am always in the middle. No highs and no lows. I just have a general apathy where I do not feel sad or happy ever. I cannot remember the last time I got excited about something. I have tried doing new things like climbing some 14k foot mountains, ziplining over huge canyons (my heart rate did not even increase), making new friends, learning guitar, traveling, etc.. but I generally do not really feel much. I just do these things and think cool... I did it, shrug my shoulders and move on. I read online that apathy is a form of depression so I am asking if my situation would warrant a doctor visit? My situation is fine overall, I just feel like I am generally numb to it all and I cannot really point to any reason why that is. Does anyone have any suggestions to get out of this middle ground gray zone I am living in all the time? Is general apathy a good enough reason to visit a doctor?",Depression
11398,"Tw: Suicidal IdeationLast weekend I met up with my ex who I used to (and still do) love very much. It was great for a day and a half...Then my anxiety started kicking in. I started over analyzing everything he did during the time we spent together. I started to ruminate. And now it feels like all of the progress I have made has gone down the drain. I was not exactly going upwards in the week proceeding the meetup either, but it was not this bad. I am currently on anti-depressants, but I feel like they are not helping right now. I had two panic attacks yesterday, over really stupid stuff that should not matter in the long run since what I was considering were hypotheticals anyway. I also got drunk for the first time tonight, and that felt good. Had some sloppy sex with an FWB, and it was good. And now I feel bad again. Empty. On the way over to his place, I started thinking about suicide again. Like what if I decided to take my antidepressants before I was fully sober again, and kill myself? What if I just stopped caring and drove my car into a pole at 50+ mph?Like, I cannot handle this. I have been in love with him for more than a year after our breakup. These feelings refuse to leave, no matter what I do. I have done talk therapy, I have gotten a new job, I have tried going to college, studying, working myself into the ground, getting enough sleep and exercise, eating healthy. All of it for a month or so at a time, and I just do not feel good. I have also tried the quick fixes, like pot, alcohol, and sex. Oh, and the anti-depressants.These things do help, do not get me wrong, but especially recently I have been feeling like utter crap. And these feelings because guilt, and because me to want to reach out to him, and I know my ex would not push me away, but I do not want to rely on him too much. And talking about these things somehow make it worse... And I feel entirely at a loss for how to express my emotions without annoying, burdening, or causing other people pain. Being in love is getting tiresome. Trying to move on is getting tiresome. Life is getting tiresome. And to be clear... I do not blame my ex for any of this. I reached out to him. It was my fault for seeing him before I was ready. it is my problem, and I need to figure out how to fix it. I am So Confused",Depression

Sure, you may be depressed also with the current sh\*t show of how the upper echelons are handling this pandemic and the never-ending lockdown that takes a toll on people's mental health, but telling others with your hard love will not help anybody.Plus, stop telling me to seek professional help. Your intention may be helpful, but I am done with the ""so-called"" mental health professionals or therapists who were being unempathetic. I hate spending my hard-earned cash on seeking professional help, only to get my mental health worse (been caught by this once), and being in a country where religion is omnipresent, are you going to see a professional advising you on religious stuff instead of supposedly helping you personally? I have been super duper wary with seeing another professional after my first experience seeing an unempathetic one ever since.Also, if you are in the good, you do not need to brag that what you did was working for you. Sure, yeah, good for you that it works, but stop expecting others to be on the same page as you too, no matter how good the intention is. Again, be empathetic. If that person does not want to do what you did, just do not force him or her further with your intentions, can you?By the very least, can people be more empathetic? everyone is dealing hard with the current situation right now, but if you are in the good (or even not so good), you do not need to be an a\*\*.

I was minding my own business, and was lying down, about to go to sleep, when a sudden felling and sensation of foreboding, as if I am going mad, sadness, came over me. It was so uncomfortable that I woke my paremts up, fearing that i would loose my mind and hurt them or myself.My parents are very supportive, and loving and i am the apple of their eyes. The feeling of foreboding did not go, and i continued to feel that sensation. My mom kept an arm around me, and I tried to sleep. I did sleep eventually, tho it was not great, but still, it was sleep.The next day i hoped i will feel okay, but then it did not go. Thoughts of wanting to harm myself came, when i literally do not have anything bad happening in my life, in fact, i was jolly and happy before the sensation. But i must say, that i was binge watching on crime vids on yt, where they discuss the criminal cases of people, and it did not affect me much, until the sudden feeling.Now, 2 days after the sensation, I no longer want to harm anyonez but yes, intrusive and poignant thoughts of arming myself are coming to me, and *do not* want to act on them. When I do not try to think about them, I am alright, but when I do, these symptoms come:Wanting to kill myself (i visibly try to shove this thought as i have no reason to do this)DiarrhoeaIncreased heart rateSomething, body shakingWanting to sleep a lot (which i like to avoid as then the depressing thoughts come back)Not wanting to speak muchUnable to concentrate/distract myselfI think i need professional help, but its too costly i guess i should speak to my fam about this, who have been very supportive of me.

12025,"Hey guys! My partner recently (2 months ago) suffered a bit of a nervous breakdown (for want of a better phrase). He was on citalopram for about 4 years previous to this and in January he started to slowly come off it, tapering the dose very gradually over the next few months until he got down to 10mg. At this point he hit a total low and got a shock so jumped himself back up to 30mg (not the best idea but he panicked). A few weeks later is when he suffered his mental breakdown, the weeks prior being full of mood swings, irritable, quick to anger, irrational thinking etc etc. Eventually it got too much. The crisis team got involved and the doctor decided that citalopram probably was not the best thing for him anymore so switched him to mirtazapine, cross-titrating it with cit for the first couple of weeks (8 weeks ago). After a couple of weeks they dropped his cit completely and upped his dose of mit to 30mg from 15mg. Its been 6 weeks since this point. At first he seemed to be getting better but about 4 weeks ago started suffering massively with depressive episodes, suicidal thoughts, extreme paranoia (effecting our relationship), obsessive thoughts, total irrational thinking, an inability to keep the bad thoughts in, quick to anger, what he calls brain tizziness which is a physical feeling apparently, tunnel vision, all the rest, you name it. Hes really struggling and is at the point where hes getting really distressed and upset at the thought that hes the only person who has ever been through this and worried that it will never get better, or maybe that hes crazy. He was discharged from the crisis team 2 weeks ago but I fear that was too earlyI was wondering if anyone here has had such horrific side effects for so long? How long did it take for them to subside? What did you do to deal with them? Is there anything I can do to help?

14674,"Something told me to make this post. I do not want sympathy, or I am sorry, or any of that. I am past that. I have made lots of posts in the past to get that kind of response. That kind of connection to another human, recognize my pain. This post is not about that, it may seem like it is, I suppose, but it is not. I guess, I just want to tell the story of why I have depression and anxiety and so many other mental illnesses. it is going to be a long post, and for that, I do not expect many people to read it.I have contemplated suicide, but never attempted it. By contemplate, I mean I held a gun in my hand, looked it up and down, loaded it, put it in my mouth, put it against my head, and thought very deeply about pulling the trigger. I have contemplated suicide for at least 10 years now. It has put me in a state where I am both godless and god-fearing. The best place to start, I think, is the first trauma I remember and go from there. When I was about 5-6 I had a crush on a boy in my class. If it matters, I am a bisexual male, more on that later. Well, I was quite innocent of the idea of love and what one should like and not like, so I told my mom about the crush. Her response was to scratch me across the face and call me a faggot. I still have the scars to this day. Four scars on the left side of my face. I made a post the other day showing my face, but you cannot really see them, I do not like to draw attention to them, and thankfully no one has ever asked about them.That is the tip of the iceberg. When my parents were still together, she would lock us out of the house. Hot summer days in the Ohio River valley. We would be out there for hours, upwards of 6 hours without water or food. And really I guess this is the lesser of it, not so bad, we were kids, play outside she would tell us. So we did, we just could not go back in until she called us. Anyways, I really looked forward to school days. This went on for a few years, I was between the ages of 5 and 10.School itself was not so bad. I did not learn to read until I was in the 3rd grade, and I was always taken out of class because I had special classes I had to go to, including one for a speech impediment, I could not say my Rs, the speech impediment went on till I was almost in High School.Well, when my parents got divorced was when the fun really began, I say fun because I try to think on the lighter side of it, could have been worse. I remember every aspect of the father's first apartment. We lived near a small airport, the house was two stories, we lived on the first floor. Entering the house, on the right was a staircase that led upstairs to the landlord's apartment. Directly in front of the front door was the door that led into the basement, where the washer and dryer were, concrete floors, largely empty space, was not much in there. The third door was my father's apartment, to the left. A white door, it led into the living room. There was a fireplace, a smallish TV, the couch my sister slept on, my dad's drawing table, and a couple of bookcases. In fact, I am going to stop here and suffice to say that I could describe to you every detail of that apartment. All except my room. I can not tell you anything about my room. I do not know what color the door was, I do not know what side of the wall the beds were on, I know nothing about that room. What I do know, or at least strongly suspect, is that I was raped in that room over a period of 2 years. Aforementioned memory lapse aside, I am told by my brother that I say ""No, do not do it, stop"" in my sleep quite often. My sister, deceased sister, had similar gaps of memory and told me one day that she suspected it was happening. And thirdly, NSFW warning, my anus has a tear in it. I was about 12-14, as memory serves that I lived in that apartment on the weekends. A mighty bold claim, I do not remember the actual events, but I believe there is evidence to lead to that conclusion. I want to think that I am wrong, but part of me tells me it is true.There are more minor things in my childhood that come to mind, but I think they really do pale compared to what I have already said. To this day, my family is, well, unloving. They will tell me they love me, but they do not show it. In fact, the only time they really listen, or half-listen, is when I threaten suicide. This could be why I contemplate it so much, just to be heard. Neither of my parents could give a shit about what inspires me, what passions I have, what love I feel. Two examples, I wanted to be a paleontologist until I was 16, loved dinosaurs, I kept this, like many other things, to myself., until one day I told my dad. He said I would never be a paleontologist, I should give up on that idea, and that I should instead be an engineer like he was. The second example, I love playing the piano, I know virtually nothing about it, I am self-taught, and frankly, I feel I can play a pretty damn good improv. My mother, frequently, tells me I am terrible at it and that I need lessons. Which may very well be true, I may be terrible and everyone else who has heard me play is lying to me, I do certainly need lessons because I cannot read music, although I do not have much interest in playing what someone else wrote, it is an emotional release for me and I like it that way, so I am stubborn.Perhaps some of this post is just whining, I need to grow up, I need to move on. I should not be defined by my past or what others say. And most of the time I try to keep that mindset, what is in the past is in the past, but (I was once told by a very wise man to not use the word but, because it negates everything you said before, I feel it is needed here) the past can still hurt. And perhaps that is why I am making this post, not on a throwaway account, I thought about that. But like my scars, let the world see this, my past does define me in some way, it has certainly shaped me. I have come to the end of this post and I still don' know the purpose. It does not make it feel any better, and no one can go back and change any of this, and quite frankly I am not even depressed about it right now. I was earlier today when my brother threatened to kick me out because I have not done the dishes in a few days, but not at the moment of writing. Maybe, and I think this is true, maybe I just need someone to know these things. Not because it has any real impact on their life, I certainly do not think anyone is going to read this and say, MY GOD, MY LIFE IS CHANGED. No, I think I just wanted someone to know my pain, my past. I suppose I am sorry you read that. Me",Depression

I understand why people who have experienced trauma can have debilitating psychological issues, my girlfriend is one of them so I can understand and empathize with her. But I am just a normal person, I have no trauma to trigger mental illness, nothing I can point to anyways, yeah my dad left me as a child, but I do not remember him. I have had alopecia since I was 7 and it has affected my social development, and of course this affected me negatively but of all the hardships I could have faced, I have it good. Yet I have been depressed as long as I can remember, my social anxiety is off the charts, I am an incompetent person, I am incapable of living a normal life, I cannot handle my responsibilities and obligations, I live like a child who expects people to clean after him and as a result my house is a mess (despite the fact that I think of myself as a neat freak and despise my living conditions) Financially I am a mess, I choose drugs and online shopping over my bills. I cannot maintain a relationship without letting my mental health affect and drag it down. I will not commit to working towards the career I dream of. I first thought about taking my life when I was in grade 3, to me it is normal to think about suicide, but when I step back and look at it, that is insane, Why would a young child want to die? What is wrong with me? and to anyone who can relate to this, what the hell is wrong with us? Why do not we possess the basic drive to live and succeed? If you read my post history you will see that I was broken up with by my fianc (whom I was with for 8 years) so it may look like I just fell into depression after that but I can assure you this has been hiding under the surface the whole time, she was a convenient crutch that I used ton hide my illness. I recently found a suicide note I wrote 2 years ago, when I was supposedly happily engaged and looking forward to my whole life. I have kind of gone on a tangent here, but back to my original point. What the hell is wrong with us? why do our brains want to kill us? I am 25 and I am supposed to be taking the world by storm and making a name and life for myself but instead I stagnate, I do nothing of value and I sleep all the time and hope that one day I just do not wake up. it is just not fair and I do not understand it.

Comment here and tell me your story, all the nitty gritty bullshit, I will read it, I will listen, And if you want, I will talk to you, I will take your pain and suffering on my shoulders, the only thing I ever feel good about is listening to others, it helps me feel less alone, because it seems like all we have is each other and I think maybe the best some of us can do is just be there for others who we can relate to Why are some of us just broken?

And now I do not even care about the pain. I had a painless death all planned but now i guess I will just throw myself out the window guys. Goodbye. And I am probably going to be alive because I am one fucking coward. So my 'father' lectured me on life today",Depression

19502,"The past couple of months have been a mess. I have gone through a break with the person I truly expected to spend the rest of my life with, my job has been unbelievably stressful, I live in a city 5 hours away from my townhome where all my friends and family are. I have very few friends here and the times I do go out, I am overcome with crazy social anxiety and do not want to talk to anyone. I also live alone and spend most nights by myself. I see a therapist weekly and immediately after my sessions I do feel better. But, it does not feel like I am making much progress and I am wasting my money. Recently I have been more reckless than normal ie. driving wayyy over the speed limit, zig zagging in and out of traffic, and blacking out more often than Id like to admit. Even though I am not suicidal, I wrote out a suicide note to address my friends and family just to see what I would say to them. I realized how little I had to say and felt really inconsequential. I am trying to take everything day by day, but I am fearful that it will get to the point where I cannot take this no more. I do not want to die, but I cannot seem to make my life more fulfilling and worthwhile. Its just starting to get to be too much. I just want to know if anyone has any advice or strategies to put themselves in better situations Looking for fulfillment in life",Depression

8583,"This is going to be a long (and not first) post on this subreddit.I am a 22 year old man, and even though I do not like it either when these posts start with a list of things people do not like about themselves (they suffer from eucharist syndrome I am going to), I believe these are in relation with my problems. I am gay, autistic, virgin, pursuing a useless degree (we will return to this), no driving lisence, barely any money under on my name, and below minimum wage income. My future is looking bleak and tbh worse than that of everyone around me. Though they can only help so much. I have yet to find the passion, drive (or whatever that makes you go from point a to point b) in my life.Who can tell well it all went wrong? My tiger mom? Maybe. My emotionally distant dad? Who knows. Sheltering and undersocialisation? Maybe. I have been dealing with depression and suicidial ideations since age 10. My parents made me go to a foreign language school (they wanted me to mingle with other ""elite"" kids) which so to speak was the most traumatic experience of my life (crying and begging my parents not to make me go there, can you guess wheter they listened?) I was bullied daily for 10 years of my life.Everyday of school was a struggle, to say I got used to this is an understatement. Even in my head I cannot find my own place in life, regular panic attacks and feelings of dread come in every month or so, demoralising and demotivating.Recently got an internship in a business consulant company where I constanly underpeform due to lack of knowledge in economics, drive and the problems listed above. I got the position on the promise that I will start a Finance BSc next semester. If being late in life in other aspects already was not enough, I am graduating with a BSc at 26 which makes me feel terrible. The feelings of dread and inadequacy just cumulate and I am getting close to being overwhelmed. Wierdly enough in times like this I want to talk and meet my mom. I want to get back into the womb where its warm and safe unlike outside here, sheltering, sheltering. I have wonderful friends and family members who love and support be but being so much behind in life compared to them and not being able to keep their advices in my head makes me feel terrible. Since my experience with most things is utter failure it does not make for a good though pattern does it? Afraid of life and in general of everything, but wierdly enough people see me as ""normal-acting"" (sic!) I guess at least I was always good at masking.This is one of my dreadful periods, each is worse than the previous. Feeling more lost than ever, positive thoughts occuring less and less. I really want this to end. Thank you. TL;DR: Years of abandonment, avoidance and deperssion resulted into a warped sense of reality which is self-fulfilling. What an ellaborate way to say I am depressed.PS.: There were ofc lot of things I did not mention which mounted up to this state of mine, but I consider those a result not a because. Thus unimportant.

The fact that I cannot even feel good on my own birthday makes me feel like a failure. Logically, I know I am not. Logically, I know shit happens. Logically, I know there will be better days. But I do not get to choose when my brain believes logic or not. So today, I am hurting really bad. All I can think about, is wishing that I did not have to be here or feel this anymore. I will not act on those feelings, but it does not change the fact that they are stuck swimming in my head and hurting the hell out of me right now. I just need to get these words out somewhere safe.

22934,"I really need to vent. I need somewhere to let this out. Forgive me if I ramble. it is been hard to focus. Today has been especially difficult. I woke up and I have been laying in bed with my lights off most of the day.. close to a year and a half ago I lost both of my children because I was unfit.. my mental health as well as having ended up in a relationship that nearly cost me my life.. several times. I felt trapped and lost everything before I could get myself together enough to get out.. now I am 25 back at my mother's house and only seeing my girls once a week for an hour.. the other day when planning my weekly visit, their father texted me that I would be unable to see them this week because they were in a wreck and totaled the truck.. he said the girls were fine but he could not even call me.. it made me realize that I was so far gone that he could not even be bothered to tell me that our children were involved in a car wreck.. Today I suppose it all finally settled in. Anytime I would exit my room for anything my mother would put me on the spot in front of everyone. ""I am fine"" I would say. To which her response was always something snarky followed by ""well you do not look fine"". I do not like when people point it out when I am like this.. it makes me feel small.. my voice is never heard because ""someone always has it worse"". I agree, but that does not mean I am not in pain.. so I closed myself off and began to sob again... my step dad, who I have never really bonded with, came into my room and allowed me to talk.. then he spoke. Shared some information that he had not even shared with my mom about his past and his mental health struggles.. it was nice. Then my mom came in upset because he did not tell her where he was going.. began to joke and play around like everything was fine. He had to tell her that this conversation was not about HER.. she took that as a joke also.. she expressed that her and my grandfather had been discussing therapy and medication options for me. Which I am opposed to and she is aware. I can function like a normal person.. I just have my days where I cannot hold it in anymore..

48059,"Everytime I think of my ""future"" I just think, ""Maybe I should kms."" because it would be so much easier and so much less painful to just kms now than it would be to struggle to just survive. I listen to my cousin and siblings...they all have their life mapped out and planned. For me, I was planning on not having a future, so I never actually made a road map to success for my life. Sometimes I wonder if it's as obvious to see that as I do.

For the longest time, I thought I would d1e before age 18, so I put off thinking about what I'd do after school. Then when I hit 18 and was still alive I just did the bare minimum to stay afloat, I kept biding my time like that hoping I'd have a spontaneous heart attack or something because of how unhealthily I treat my body.

But yet I'm still here ... why? 

How come hundreds of thousands of people who wanted to live died at an early age, but I who want to die am still here when I've not taken care of myself in so long... why, why, why?

I don't understand why the world is doing this to me. Even though my thoughts of death have been pretty passive, it's not like they don't affect me at all. Everytime I get my tiny paycheck and see that I don't have enough to afford more than 1 meal a day I just want to die more. All I asked for was a job that I don't hate, that pays me a wage to live on my own...back in my parents day it seemed like that was actually doable relatively easily from the stories they both tell. Why is that not the case anymore? Or is it just me?

Again I ask, if the world wants me to live so much, than why make it so goddamn hard to actually live??? 

I'm so fcking tired of living. Nothing here is worth it. I hate this fcking world. I hate every single person on this planet. I hate my stupid job. Hate my stupid boss. I hate how everything revolves around money. I hate the society humans created. I hate myself for not just being born a normal person.

Par for the course of my entire life she named me in the second group. I laughed it off but I am honestly devastated, not surprised mind you since only one girl has ever fancied me and that was over a decade ago.

All of us slightly pressured her to answer the question and I personally told her to be honest about it.&amp;#x200B;Thanks for reading, even if it is only one or two of you. I have nobody to tell about this but I REALLY needed to get it off my chest. Even though I am devastated right now I am sure I will recover again like I have done time and time and time again.

18868,"I do not know why I keep doing this and honestly I do not know why I came up this way, the only thing I can conclude is that I fell in despair so deeply? Let me explain or at least try to confess you why I do what I do, because even if you will think I am weird that is okay, because yknow, not everybody DESERVE good things in life. But you DO!I am sorry if you do not understand my way of expressing myself or my bad grammar or English, that is okay because I just cannot do anything right, but English is not my native language.I always felt odd and I feel I had to fake my entire life to seem more normal possible, so maybe that is why I am here after all.I always envied people who knows what they want in life, and had a normal childhood, I do not know why, but I cannot let go my past Ill probably never will.I consider myself nothing, so If I was nothing I could be anything right? But no.I tried so hard to fit in a normal life style, taking inspiration from the people I loved, I wanted to be as closest as possible to them! But, I was just lying to myself, and things only went downhill.My family does not care about me, at all, I do not blame them, after alla I think they would be more happy with me.I look outside my window and I see everyone begin so happy.I wanted to feel happiness but everything I felt was emptiness and so much self hate.I do not blame people who use drugs or use any substance, if I had money or way to do that, I would because i refuse to live in a world with myself, at least even for fews seconds, I would like to feel something else other than emptiness.Day passed, and I tried to be positive, my mental health deteriorated, so I started to give in in my self destructive habits.I fasted, because why not? I lived in a body i hated, i world that show me Beaty but made me despise myself even more.I fasted with just caffeine tea or coffee, if I got hungry I ate some fruit.All my days where spent watching the walls or hurting myself in some way or writing in my dairy all the shitty things happened in my daily life.This was until I fainted on the supermarket, my sister and mother were so fucking bothered by this, and i felt like shit because I cannot do anything right. But after that something changed in me.I though I was dead and I felt so...blessed?But, after waking up all I was thinking was how I can get closer to it.So I stared to planning all the bad thing I could do to myself.I was quite good at it, but when a car hit me, not to the point of hurting me that bad I realised that I did not wanted to die that way.I wanted, yeah, someone who could kill me.Its so strange to think that, but, I could not help that.When I sat on the edge on my window I always thought if someone would even bother to do something to me.Killing is not easy and most of the people would know that prison is waiting for them, but its so hard to not think about it.I realised that there is nothing more than I want than someone who wants me dead, at least who wants to feel that they want to do that to me, because I would feel so alone if they would feel forced.I do not know why I would feel so worth it in this persons arms. The closest am I to death, the more i feel worth it.",Depression

Its gotten so bad that I finally convinced my parents to be okay with me going to the doctors to try medication. My appointment is coming up and my parents keep making their disapproval evident. They are extremely against medication for mental illness but they are tolerating it because they blame my depression and anxiety for why I am such a disappointment in their eyes. However they are still not happy abt it. When I first talked to them abt it I thought they were finally on my side but it does not seem that way anymore.

47921,"Trying to help a friend, I’m in over my head. Please help! Greetings, I am new to this sub and relatively new to Reddit. Let me give you some background on why I’m posting here. I ran across a post about a month ago from a young teenager about being depressed and all that (you know, the typical teenage woes). Out of kindness, I replied with some words of comfort, and after a while we started messaging and have kept in touch since. I am by no means an expert (outside of my personal experience dealing with depression and anxiety most of my adult life), but all signs point to him having some sort of mental health issues.

Like everyone, he has had good days and bad days, but lately things have taken a darker turn and I’m realizing I’m in over my head. For a while our conversations never involved suicide, and I know I’m not really equipped to help people struggling with those thoughts, but now it’s come up a few times and I’m starting to feel like I could be in danger of inadvertently saying the wrong thing or somehow making the situation worse. My first inclination was to steer him in the direction of talking to parents or another trusted adult, getting therapy, etc., but for several reasons that’s not an option right now.

At this point, I’m completely committed to helping this kid get the help he needs and I won’t abandon him just because this situation has become more complicated than I originally anticipated. I started myself down this road, and I won’t give up until I know he’s safe or at least in the right hands. I don’t want to get into any details in this post, but I could really use some advice from anyone who understands how to talk to a very depressed / suicidal kid who probably has mental health issues and is desperately searching for a reason to keep living.",Depression

9101,"I do not know if I have depression or not. What I do know is that feeling the absolute fucking worst about everything and everyone around me happens quite often and never truly goes away. This knowledge that my mind goes to this place so often always stays at the back of my mind and I am always acutely aware of it regardless of whatever else I am doing. I can see it in my own eyes every time I look in the mirror. Sometimes I wonder whether other people see it too, although I would guess not. Because no one checks up on me and the one person that claims to care about me is pretty shitty and inconsistent, although she is the best I have got. I lost all my friends over a year ago and I know they all still talk about me from time to time, which I am not sure if I appreciate or not. In this past year I have met a handful of people, but still feel lonely and could not identify anyone who I would actually call a close friend, nor do I delong to any kind of group of friends. In other words I am lonely. Sometimes I miss my old friends so bad and other times I am glad I do not speak to them for who they have become since then. I think this is around where my problems start but I do not know that for certain either. I am currently living in the worst stage of my life so far and I do not know if I will make it out. I am 19 and only a few years ago I had a clear view of what I wanted my life to turn out like and where it was going to go.

I had been so lost and depressed and I found some one who showed real interest in me...some one who loved me for me. But I had my own issues and problems. I hurt her over and over (not physically and I never cheated) and she gave me chance after chance. We had a beautiful baby girl 13 months ago...finally I had the family I always wanted...A family of my own, a beautiful wife and daughter. But I continued to screw myself and her over with my actions...I was not present mentally...I was not supportive enough. We would get into arguments that made both of us want to kill our selves. we have both tried at different points...we both self harm. But now its all over...our relationship is dead to her. She really tried, I did not try nearly hard enough. I did love her, I really did...but I am just a selfish bastard. We did not end in a horrible way at all, in fact we still live together for the sake of our daughter. But for all the times I have hurt her...for all the chances I had...I guess this karma coming full circle? I just feel so broken, hollow and cold. Like I am not the one who should get any form of pity...I felt so bad that I need to vent in some way...to feel...something. I cut my self bad enough to need a hospital visit...I guess that box cutter was not as dull as I thought. But the funny thing is I did not even feel it...I feel like I am regressing back into the person I used to be...the one who shuts out the world. Cutting made me feel better for a little bit...but its not enough. I do not want to die, more like I cannot die. My daughter did not ask to be here, and I owe it to her to stay around for her.

48051,"I feel like I wasn't meant to be born (literally) (tw for mentions of sexual (specifically CSA), physical, and emotional abuse, incest, suicidal ideation, abandonment, grief, parental loss, and harrassment. let me know if i need to add anymore)

not in the suicidal way (ok maybe a bit). i *LITERALLY* feel like it was against the universe for me to be born and now I'm living a waking nightmare due to going against nature

my dad almost got in a fatal crash years before i was born and my mom had multiple miscarriages before having me

i was born early and when they xrayed me (because i was having trouble breathing) my intestines were tied. i was quickly flown to another hospital and when they xrayed me again i was suddenly fine.

i think this was all a warning sign

here's why i think I'm cursed:

since then i have been sexually abused (exclusively by different family members), emotionally abused, physically abused, neglected, got ptsd from medical malpractice, been abandoned veryvery suddenly by multiple people i have known for years, diagnosed with over 6 different mental disorders (there's probably more waiting to be discovered as well), and lost my stepdad due to a fatal accident on Christmas day 2022. 

since then his entire family has been harrassing us and trying to take his dogs from us out of purely spite. his mom thinks my mom is at fault (he had 100% brain death and my mom gave them the ok to take him off the icu) and she admitted to my mom she's trying to make me more suicidal so that i kill myself not because she has anything against me personally, but because my death would destroy my mom.

all of the stuff i listed has taken place in a span of 9 years. each year i experienced an extreme traumatic event. I'm only 18. i never got to properly experience my teenage years.

other random stuff i need to get off my chest and that also make me feel like I've been cursed:

i have Premenstrual Dymorphic Disorder (PMDD). I consider it the worst out of all the other disorders i have. two weeks out of every month my body and brain torture me. when i was told at 16 im to young to legally have a hysterectomy (the only known cure for most pmdd patients) and i would have to try almost every medication for pmdd before a doctor would consider it i started sobbing. I'm still trying different medications. The current one isn't working well so far.

i also might have to leave the place I've lived for 9 years for another country within the next 2 due to the fact I'm trans and things have been feeling more unsafe in the US as of late. what's especially difficult (and the cherry on top) is that I'm autistic so even minor changes are REALLY really hard. i also have a lot of friends and a community here. it just seems the major life changes have just been ramping up lately. I've been experiencing psychotic episodes lately due to sheer stress.

basically I'm trying to say that whenever something good finally happens and i can rest for a second it gets taken away from me. i can't remember the last time my body wasn't slightly tense actually

i feel like i can't tell my mom or even my friends I've had for years anything. all this trauma has left me not knowing how to emotionally open up. i feel so isolated even in a room of people i love. I've recently become emotionally and mentally unstable with my personality, morals, and behavior completely shifting in a single second. I feel like i can't trust anyone. I feel out of control.

I feel like i have upset the universe with my existence.

(ps don't ask me how my intestines can tie and then untie themselves i genuinely don't know. that's just what I've been told by everyone that was there. also i hope I'm ok to post this here. if not please let me know and I'll take it down. apologies if I'm not very coherent. i hope you all have a good day💖)",Depression

20602,"I have been bullied by classmates and teachers alike for about 10 years. Although I mostly remembered my classmates making fun of me, insulting me, pulling my hair and god knows what else, with time I realised it was the teachers and my parents that had the biggest impact. I have had teachers that would often make fun of me in front of the whole class if I gave the wrong answer or did not know how to do something. Either that or just screaming at me. One of them would often tell me I am a failure and I will forever be a disappointment to my parents because I, the daughter of two engineers, was not great at math. My parents suggested I move schools at some point but the thought of being thrown into a new class with people who already knew each other scared me even more so...they did nothing else. Whenever my dad tried helping me out with my maths homework, he would sooner or later lose his patience and scream at me as well. he would sometimes throw my notebooks in anger as well. I was so terrified I did not have the courage to say anything at all, being convinced that none of the answers I could come up with was right. I thought it would be better to just not say anything, but that just made him angrier. And the same happened at school. I just became too scared to say anything at all. We never really talk about this. Whenever the subject comes up, they of it as if it is just another funny story from my childhood. it is very hard for me to talk about it; whenever I try to explain how I felt they just brush it off and act as if it was not all that serious. they would often make jokes about me being rather introverted and quiet, often in front of other people - and they still do it, to this day. My mum especially likes to ""excuse"" my quietness in front of other people as if it is this terrible flaw that just needs to be explained away. I have asked her not to do that, explained why it upsets me, and every time it seems like she gets it...until the next time when she does it again.Luckily I do not live with them anymore, but whenever I do go back for more than a week, something like this always happens.

9522,"Tw: idk which ones to put but I feel like I should mention that there might be triggers in here.I have dealt with suicidal ideation for as long as I can remember. In fact it was one of the only things I could remember- being so young and always thinking I wish I was never born. I did not sign up for this life. When I had kids there overwhelming amount of guilt I had because I was anti-natalist.That is pretty much the only outstanding memory I have of my childhood. Any other small snippets I have were never happy or anything like that. I always felt like some bad shit went down during my childhood but I honestly thought I was crazy for thinking that. Or I was in denial because I knew it but everything.... Everything on the outside where I was standing looked so perfect.This has been driving me crazy. I have been going through my spiritual journey and along with that, for me, was realizing how toxic my parents are in the present but I always felt like I was just making things up. Overreacting. Making a big deal out of nothing.I have basically been begging my sister (7 years older than me) to tell me what happened for a while and finally, this weekend we talked. Everything that I had suspicions of was confirmed. She told me stories that I could not remember and now I can.Turns out our childhood was far more abusive than I remember. When I was 3, my sister 10 and my brother 12, my sister and I watched our mom beat our brother so bad my sister thought she was going to kill him.That was the missing piece. that is when my brain started protecting me. that is when I started repressing memories. My sister protected me. She taught me how to survive and I have been holding on to those coping mechanisms for 29 years. I did not even know what they were. I have actually been self diagnosing myself (knowing it does not actually mean anything) trying to find an answer about why I am the way I am... All because I thought I was crazy about my childhood but yet I knew there was something wrong with me. Turns out I am actually the product of an extremely physically, sexually, and mentally abusive childhood. It was a moment where I realized literally my entire personality was a trauma response. But everything ""wrong"" with me are coping mechanisms my sister taught me so that I could survive.So now, I finally have answers. I guess I feel kind of numb. It felt like I had done a 1,000 piece puzzle and my sister took off my blindfold to reveal the picture. She took my denial blindfold off.The hardest thing now is that I have kids and my kids adore my parents. But I do not think I can let my kids around these people again. Certainly not unsupervised. My parents act like they are perfectly normal people. In some ways, they are not the same people, but actually they are... They are exactly the same people, they just know they cannot act like that now. we are all grown up and now they cannot hurt us without going to jail.In a way, I feel untouchable now. They cannot hurt me anymore, not really. But I know deep down, if they felt justified, they would destroy my life. Try to get my kids taken away from me, something. They also know I could destroy their lives too. I feel numb.So now I am waiting. I am waiting on my sister, maybe my brother too, before I confront them. I cannot wait to confront them. I have so much to say. I have my anthem ready to hype me up and terrify them to compliance. They have never once, let me out of their sight because I think they know I am their greatest threat to living a normal retirement and allowing them to forget what they did to us. I am their greatest threat and it feels fucking good to know that they are scared of me and what I can do. They do not think I have what it takes but when the time comes, it will be a glorious judgement day. I just found out my childhood was way worse than I thought",Depression

He does not have depression, and cannot relate to how I feel, I have told him a few times how life feels, but not really told him anything in detail about the thoughts and feeling that go through my head everyday. He is honest (which I appreciate), and tells me that he just does not really understand if I say anything like that. I just have nobody to talk to, and next year the one true friend I have left is gone. If I try to vent to somebody, they get scared away, no matter how close they are to me.",Depression

11049,"Well here it goes since this is my first post here and just looking for a positive comment or maybe some advice. I will start off by saying that I am 21 and unemployed. I have a GF and we are great together. I have family that is within an hour drive. I have a decent support system in my life. But lately I have just felt bland about everything. Any hobbies I enjoyed have kind of died and I do not have much hobbies other than gaming. While I have been unemployed for the last few months I have been trying to get my head straight, I quit my E-Cigarette mid May. Used to smoke alot of weed. Now I have cut back and using that as a reward instead of a nightly ritual. Since I have been off work I have been trying to figure out what my interests are and what I could see myself doing in the future as a steady career. I will be honest... I am a lazy guy. I go for walks sometimes to get me out of the house. Listen to podcasts. Apply for jobs. Gaming seems to be the only thing that I slightly enjoy simply because all the action is happening infront of me, I am not physically moving but I am controlling what is happening in the game so that is entertaining for me. I have gotten job offers and I always find something wrong with them, whether it be the commute, the pay, or the hours (too early or too late). I just cannot seem to get any traction, any motivation. I just do not really know what to do. I look at our planet and hate it because it is dying and we HAVE to do something but big company's are not doing anything. Society is breaking down slowly but surely. I do have a doomsday mindset I will admit and I am trying to kick it, but it is hard when there is so much negativity and so little positivity in the world. Everyone just keeps saying to me ""you will be back on your feet and feeling better once you get a job"". For some reason I do not believe them. I feel like I do not fit in this world sometimes, that I am a wasted space. That I do not want to live, but I do not want to die either. I just simply exist and I am not enjoying it as much as I once did. So what is a good stepping stone to start with? A rant about myself",Depression

21132,"This post is not going to be about my vivid and memorable bad experiences, instead it is going to be more general; but if you want to learn about my current mental health status, read this post, it will be helpful: [ So, as I remember, it is going to be my second post in here; I just hope that I will not be ignored again, as just like the first post... As the title goes on, I especially hate my generation; not because I feel different from them, just because they are so cruel, shameful, and disgusting; as I see more hateful things done by people, from this generation, I just want to take my local gun and put a bullet in my head; I am a sensitive person, and I have situationally both predisposed and bound or cued panic attacks; I am being affected so much by tragic deaths, broken relationships, unexpected depressing messages, and much more crisis triggering things... I will give you a current example of me being in depression, feeling low, and why; there is a known event going on these days, a crime which happened two years ago has just went popular on social media again, it is going to be her death anniversary on ""**14th**"" of this month; shortly, just after two days; I do not want to give out more details about the murder because I feel bad and uncomfortable with it, and I will explain the connection between my sadness and this event. On her ""**Instagram**"" account, there is a picture posted two years ago today; and when I went to the comment sections, of all posts, they were just so many disgusting and hateful comments; there were people telling that she deserved it, and some of them also making fun of her death; and another strange thing was, there were so many people from my country flooding the comment sections, which is so goddamn strange; and yeah, some of them were trying to be like the other foreign people and making hateful comments, and the other half was just acting like they have known the event for a long time; after seeing those things, I once again, hated world and especially my countries people, then I learned that the people from my country were coming from **TikTok**, and from a recent popular hashtag in my country; I feel so bad and sad that they are people out there, using these types of events to receive more likes and followers, to receive more attention; and yeah, do not you ever ask me again why I hate social media so much, especially **TikTok**. I got affected by the event so much; and those comments, they was the spice of the thing; now I am feeling so damn low that I just want to end myself, I am done with everything, I just want to go and stab the murderer in the neck so many times; my anger about this type of events are just uncountabl, and because of my character and psychological personality, I always blame myself for such things and hate myself because I am not or were not able to do anything; like, I do not even want to continue to this article, I just feel low and do not want to type things on the keyboard... You got the point; this event was just an example, and the fact that I have much more things going on on my life right now; I am not suicidal, but I will not hesitate if I get a chance to end myself too... No matter if or how you just want to reach out, I will both answer to all of your comments and DM's; please do not hesitate to ask such things, they can be related to anything, I would love to answer your questions and clean up those question marks; and also, please do not also hesitate to share your thoughts, completely... My only wish is, just do not be too offensive; thanks. The world is a bad, disgusting, and a hateful place; I want to end myself just because of this...",Depression

17872,"This is just one long rant.My family fights. Mainly, it is just Daniel and I, Daniel being the one my mom married before I was born. I do not consider him anything close to a father figure, but he is the only thing I have other than teachers, counselors, or school staff. Fighting has taken a toll on me, a lot. I am always the one at fault and he makes sure to phrase it in a way that makes me the one in the wrong, always. This has ended up with me scared of loud noises, feeling like a failure, feeling unloved, depressed, scared of hurting people, scared of being around people, scared of making mistakes, scared of offending people, scared of authoritarian figures that would coincide with father figures, defensive, rude in many cases, and in some ways, unable to properly read cues, though this might be an autism thing. For just over ten years, we have been digging a huge pit of anger and hate, mainly my hate for him, and the grief that comes with not feeling loved by someone who you see everyone else loved by. The depression stemming from the constant battling has ended me up in hospital three times due to being suicidal after fights, mainly because I feel like a disappointment. I end up wanting to punch him in the face, push him out the door, and lock every single entrance but I will never be strong enough emotionally for that. I am already a failure as is.I find it incredibly hard to cry, mainly because of how much I did in the early years, and have ended up being semi-violent when it comes to confrontations with him. I will end up throwing things or slamming doors because I want to get away from him at all costs, I want to put something in between me and him. This usually ends up with me wanting to kill myself, like today. I did the only thing I could think of in the midst of the pain and depression today, I left the house and walked to the open space nearby. there is a bench there I am fond of. I managed to cry up there. I am glad nobody was out today. I contemplated commiting. I am glad I did not. I contemplated running away. I am glad I did not. The only thing keeping me sane is the people I love and I hate it so much. I feel like I should live for more than just spite and to make others happy. I just want to be happy.The thing that hurts the most is when I see families having fun together. A dad and his child reading a book on the sidewalk. A mom and her daughter walking the family pets. A husband and wife taking their toddler in a stroller.It makes me feel raw hate. Hate to myself that I cannot be a better person. Hate to myself that I cannot have that because I cannot control what little temper I have. Hate that despite everything I do, he cannot take responsibility for anything. I hate it. I hate me.How can I be happy when my whole life is pain and sadness? How can I be happy when the person I am supposed to look up to despises me more than the dogs I pass in their yards? Why do the *dogs* pause to see if I am ok longer than he does. I want happiness. Please. I would give anything for that peace.tldr: I am in pain. I hate myself, my dad, everything I am.

I see no reason to continue. I am a burden on my family. They'd be better off not having to deal with me. I basically don't exist so there is no reason for me to try to. 
I want help but I cannot get any. I cannot reach out. I am unable of talking to people. I literally cannot speak to most people. My family won't belive me or take me seriously and I'm scared of them. I want to die but if I do then I will die as somebody else. I just want to be me. But I cannot. I have been trying for so long. I have tried to keep going but I am reaching a point where I feel like I'm going insane. I want to scream and destroy something. I want this feeling to just end but it won't. I don't want this life. I wish I wasn't me. I wish I were just normal. Or just had never existed. I should have never existed. We should never have been twins. I am only an inconvenience. I am disgusting. I don't deserve my life. I don't deserve to eat. I don't deserve my family. I don't deserve help. I don't deserve to be loved.",Depression

9182,"I just really want to get this out, and maybe please hopefully someone has some words that might be able to help at all. I am really really sorry about it being so long, I just need to get it outIm a 26 year old Indian man grown up in quite a traditional household in the UK, which means mental health is always a taboo subject, and as such I have never brought up any issues I have had with my parents. I think on some level they might know I have experienced issues in some capacity, given I have done a lot of reading on the subject, and done charity work for mental health charities etc. but a part of me wonders if their upbringing makes it obvious to believe that its a true problem that is not sorted with a hugSo I went to a good school, excellent university, had great grades, show great social skills as a front whenever I need to, had a good job, then took a two years out and moved to Japan, and now moved back a month ago living with my parents for the first time in 8 years.Something is wrong, I just feel so mentally fragile all the time. Nothing I do gets me any mental strength and I run on a rolling 1-2 day cycle of feeling ok then heavy and useless again. As a backstory, I grew up with no friends, a situation I actually do not remember as I have recently realised I have SDAM (Inability to remember anything than the most recent few years). Which I always saw as a positive, because whatever it was, it was in the past, and I am beyond that. From 18-20 in university I always felt completely mentally strong and myself. Then at the same time found out about some infidelity in my father, the only person I had felt close to until that time (excluding my brother), and the only person Id ever call if anything went wrong. Fortunately those trust issues were compensated for by finding my first love at the time, but then when I moved to America, this was compensated for by drinking excessively for that entire year, pretty much joining a frat and drinking all my troubles away for the year without talking to my family at all. That year concluded in breaking up with my girlfriend at the time due to further lies and infidelity from her side. Then back in the UK to finish my studies and started work for a few years. After the initial getting over the trust from my ex, these 3-4 years were probably the strongest of my life. I felt confident, over all the trust issues (or so I thought), regained my relationship with family and friends. I had a great job, a great house, good circle of friends. Just a great all round time.Then I went to Japan, and again, the first 6 months of my life were some of the most exciting, new city, new culture, incredible new career, learning so much about myself. And found love for the 2nd time, which happened to be during covid quarantine, and as such went from 0-100 which was the most incredible and comfortable 3 months of my life. As someone who people say, connect with them in a way they have never experienced all the time, finding truly someone who I feel that relationship reciprocated is very rare for me, so was very excited. Then slowly over the next year and a half that turned into a steady comfortable relationship. Were very different people, but somehow it worked, I think she slowed me down in a much needed way. Although my good times previously were very mentally strong, it was very high-functioning, and I probably needed someone who just lived in the now bringing me back to a healthier version of ""strong mind""However again through a few of half-truths and lies about the past from her side over the next 3 months, sort of put a damper on it, and made me continually question the relationship. The thing is this time round, although not condoning it, I can actually see the logic as to why there was lies, and in my clearest mind can see that we still have a confident future together, as there was no malicious intent. Long story short, the year since then has been a constant rumination of mental battles on the SAME issues over and over again, mainly trust, and whenever I get stuck thinking about it, it takes me weeks or even months to get over it and regresses me back into my worst depressive states. And although I do not know the true because, the more I think about it, rather than from the actual issues from the relationship, I think the underlying issues with my previous trust being broken in my father and first love have put me in a position where although I want to, I cannot just let go of the past with the new relationship, and I struggle trust again, and this just screws up my whole mind.These ruminations were kept at bay while in Japan, because I was still surrounded with the loving relationship and doing meditation, yoga, and surfing to keep my mind as clear as possible. Although often getting stuck, I found myself getting out of it much quicker. The only way it really did however was to almost limit the longevity of the relationship in my mind, to limit how much the hurt caused me to become unfunctional as a human Now back in the UK for a month and I am STUCK beyond belief. I feel like the same thought loops get stuck in my head, and I find myself going over the same thing, and the same conversations with my brain trying to apply some logic as to why I should get over it. All this does is mentally weigh me down beyond belief, and just continually ruin my day-to-day life. And now I cannot bring myself to do any of the things which helped, yoga, meditation. Everything just gets me stuck in a way I cannot live. I do not know if its the being back at my parents home after so long, the relationship lack of trust, the lack of job, the culture shock or just all of them. I think with my idle mind is the devils plaything, and most of all it seems to be playing on my relationship view and ruining my mind.Now my every interaction just leads me into a state of mental instability. Today my parents came back after a day out and told me they bought me some new bedsheets as a gift, but the prospect of anything new / surprise / out of the ordinary just breaks me, and I had to walk away saying I did not want it, half angry, while trying to hold back tears. Just crumbing mentallyThen all I can do is get angry at myself for acting like a dick in the face of a kind gesture from people who love me.I just do not know what to do, nothing I do feels like it helps, and I do not want to do anything other than stay in bed all day, while I am torn about putting on a brave face to my parents so they do not see it in me. I want to get back to the healthy self I was at any point in my life, but do not know how to do it.If anyone can read this and maybe provide any help, something to do, something to focus on, anyone who is been through something similar, or even someone to talk to, I would be really appreciative.I am really sorry again for the long post. do not know how to continue in life",Depression

23061,"I am cross-posting this to the depression sub-reddit from the bipolar one as I feel like it would be helpful to get the input from people on both sides!TW: self harmHey, I am really hoping that someone here can help me. I know diagnosing is not allowed in this sub, but just hoping that someone who has been diagnosed can tell me if it is something that sounds similar to what they experience, and if so I plan on going to the doctor. Hoping this is not too long! Thank you in advance for reading.I was diagnosed with depression 5 or 6 years ago when I was 19 (now 24), and I have never actually doubted that - until recently. I am not sure the best way to go about this so I am just going to list the reasons why I think I might be bipolar (based on symptoms that I have found out by googling).1. The best way to describe myself and my mental state at any time is that I have two halves of me - the ""good"" half, and the ""bad"" half. When I am in my ""good"" half, I cannot imagine what it is like to be in the ""bad"" half, and vice versa.2. The switches between these two halves can be very sudden. Last week, I felt suicidal and the most depressed I would felt in a very long time. I self harmed 7 times in one day. My therapist asked me if I had been able to process the emotions I was feeling last week and I literally could not even imagine them. I feel optimistic about the future, I feel more energised, I actually enjoy doing my hobbies. I always thought this was normal for depression...3. Whenever I have good days with my depression, they are ALWAYS followed by even worse days. It got to the point that I actually hate feeling happy because I know that I am going to feel even worse after it, and it does not seem worth it. During those happy days, I am sociable, I chat to people a lot, I enjoy going about my life and being busy. I feel confident that I am good at my work, I know why I was given this position. During the depressed days after, I struggle to even get out of bed, I cancel hanging out with people, I sit and scroll on my phone, cannot be bothered to do anything (I am addicted to caffeine and I cannot even make myself go and get coffee - I will just let the withdrawal symptoms happen), I wear my comfort clothes (like my blanket jumper and pjs).4. My mood can switch in an instance. The other day, I was having a breakdown, hated myself, could not get up and I could not stop crying. Literally a minute later, I stopped crying, felt happy and able to be productive. Got up, went and made myself a drink, tidied the house, did the dishes...5. I often fluctuate with how much I want to see other people - there are times I love hanging out with friends, meeting new people, hanging out with colleagues... others, I just want to stay home with my husband and dog, close the curtains and shut out the world.6. I often flip from feeling happy and content to insanely frustrated for incredibly minor reasons where my whole body feels ridiculously tense and I snap at people a lot, then get really confused why I am so irritable - normally happens after a good day where I have felt fairly ""normal"" and happy.7. Speaking of normal, this is something I do not really understand. I do not ever have ""normal"" periods, my ""normal"" is that I do not feel anything, I struggle to do work and my seemingly stable mental state is very precarious, it takes very little to knock it back to depressed again.I feel like this makes no sense, but I am hoping that someone can read it and understand. I am currently taking an antidepressant (sertraline) and it does not seem like it is doing anything for me. I have tried other antidepressants but none that work.Please someone help... do not know if I am bipolar or just depressed",Depression

Sometimes my depression is the entire room or the building and I sink into it with no way out and at times its a tiny ball that I can throw away for a moment only for it to creep back larger than ever.. It used to be better for me I could move to different city and it felt like the depression was behind for while, but it always caught upto me and always getting its hold on me.. Now my depression is my entire home and even if I try to escape it follows me, coats me into armour that protects me from every good feeling, every little bit of hope and it keeps me locked in tight, squishes me to the husk I have become..Today I tried to break the armour, I paid off the loans I had and went to drive on this road next to the ocean to see if I could sneak away into the darkness of the sea with my car and end it all.

7405,"I went to residential for 2 weeks and it was amazingly helpful. It did so much to change my outlook on things. While I was gone, my wife realized she can not keep doing this. I spent all of my momentum coming out of residential on convincing her to at least give us a chance. I was able to get a job, only one place even reached out after I applied. It is physically wrecking my body. I am in pain every day. The pay is crap. Plus I am sleeping in the guest room which has a shitty mattress. I do not know if I can make it through this. I got home from work tonight actually feeing pretty good. My wife was out so I just lounged around for a bit. I felt like I was getting some of my confidence back. Then it came crashing down around me. I am still a fat ass, unattractive. My wife told me before I even went to residential that we needed to stop with the physical in part because I need to lose weight. Before she got home I moved my shotgun out of our, sorry *her* room and put it in my closet. Just in case. I promised her months ago that suicide was off the table, that I was all in. What good did that do me? I applied to yet another job. If I do not get it, I think that will be the end of it all. It will be the first time I fire my shotgun. With my luck it will not work. I can not even work up enough to care. Falling Again",Depression

15464,"Anyone reliving past failures in your mind or feel really heartbroken the way life turned out? (Especially after waking up)It hits hard (almost unbearably) in the first 5 seconds of waking... it is like a unexplainable gigawatt jolt of sheer pain/anxiety/heartbreak/fear all at one time at the moment of waking. I can feel it physically in my chest and sometimes in my head (kind of hard to explain...not quite a headache but it is physical discomfort). Seconds later I get unfilterted replays of various painful past experiences in my mind. Each time I wake up, it is a different set of past experiences... different time periods of my past. Sometimes even a voice saying, 'And this is why you are now' in my head.it is like the few times I can shut out my brain from depressive thoughts is when I am asleep. I can have a dream of what I wanted to be my perfect past. Or have a nightmare of a past failure(s). Either way it is emotionally inciting to the point of euphoria. When I wake up...bam...my instinct is, 'dammit, I am waking up and facing the reality of my life, not this crap again.'Then for 10 mins after waking, I have to calm myself from the emotion. Sometimes I reflect on the dream and meditate my way out of the disappointment that it is not reality...or I reflect on nightmare and what that negative past did to me. If I do not remember the dream, it still takes a bit of time to shake off the 'waking anxiety' (As I call it). Those replays mentioned.This happens almost everyday. The anxiety/depression drops a lot after about 15 to 20 mins, but not entirely...it resonates at varying levels thoughout the day when I am awake. Need help with morning depression.",Depression

48017,"Things were going great until a few days ago So I’ve been battling with both anxiety and depression for the last seven years and last six months, I felt good better than I have in a long long time.  But I don’t know what’s going on, but I suddenly feel like nothing is worth it anymore. 

I’ve been ignoring everything assignments tests just staying in my room and laying in bed. I even skipped my classes today.

I don’t know if this matters or something, but my closest friend is basically going through a mental breakdown and it just reminds me of myself and the situation I was in a couple of years ago.  

And she’s the only person currently that I could talk to because the people I trusted before we’ve kind of lost touch, and I don’t know how to talk to her without making things worse for her. 

I wish there is someone I could talk to, but at the same time I have really really bad trust issues and I don’t open up to people. 
The last person apart from my friends that I let in broke my heart, so people are not really my favourite right now. 

I just need something, I don’t know what but I just want to feel better. I was doing so well and I hate feeling so empty. I hate feeling like I don’t care because I care. Just can’t get myself to do anything about it.
I don’t know what to do I just want this to go away. 

I haven’t felt like this in a year. Even then I didn’t feel this bad. 
I can’t seem to figure out why I’m just so unaffected by anything rn. 
I don’t know what triggered me. 

I’ve cried all morning and honestly I hate being vulnerable I just don’t want to feel this awful anymore.",Depression

15434,"Maybe a long post, I do not care who reads this. I just have a lot of stuff I want to get off my chest. Or maybe I just want someone to listen, who knows lolAnyway as the title says, I am really convinced I will one day kill myself. Maybe not right now, but I am sure it will definitely happen. I have always had suicidal thoughts, I have even tried to attempt many times. So I know I have it in me to do it, I just do not know when, or what is stopping me. I am only 17 and I feel like I have so much going on. I have been put on an antidepressant early last month, and I have been going to therapy ever since, but I still feel so hopeless and so disgusted with myself. My self hate is sometimes unbearable, to the point I do not eat or ever take care of myself. I have lost so much weight over the past couple months it is scarring my familyI feel like the medicine I am on has helped me be more social around my family and in a better mood, (sorry if this sounds strange) but I kind of feel like I am better able to hide my feelings? Almost like I am wearing a mask around everyone. I still feel the same as I have always been, still hating myself, not eating, yknow the same stuff I have been doingI want to tell my therapist that I have been having suicidal thoughts recently (like a bunch), but I do not want to scare my family (I am a minor so I believe my therapist will tell my parents), or maybe even be sent somewhere. it is also gotten to the point where I have really vivid dreams about death, or killing myself and being happy about it. I have also have been struggling with self harm for the past months too, and I feel like I have been doing it more than usual. I have been doing it on my thigh so it is been easy to hide, but I have gone against my self rule of not doing it on my wrist. Everything is weird, the pain does not really bother me anymore. I will do anything to maybe hate myself less. I want to reach out about these problems to someone, but like I said earlier I am scared. I cannot imagine what will happen when my family finds out I have been self harming. Sometimes I even catch myself making plans to kill myself, thinking about how I would do it, when, the most painless and quickest way to do it. I have came to conclusion that hanging myself may be my best bet, but to do it at night. I know my family would miss me, and I would because great pain, but honestly I do not care what happens. As long as I am not here, as long as I am not me, I do not want to exist anymore. I hate it I hate everythingI swear I feel so horrible about everything, anything I do, sometimes I will have to catch myself because I feel I have embarrassed myself or that I am doing to much. I have not even really been doing my favorite things anymore, I have not even been listening to music which I used to everyday. I just sit and do nothing, I cannot bring myself to find the motivation to do anythingI also start school soon, like next month and this will be my second year at this new school. And also my final year of highschool. Honestly my junior year was horrible, my grades were falling, and I literally had no friends, when I tell you I would literally not open my mouth to talk to anyone I mean it. I feel weird about talking to people, I feel I am not worth anyone's time so why bother? I feel I really gave up that year, I did not try with outfits, I just wore a hoodie and jeans every single day. I cannot imagine how I will feel when I start again, I do not know if I can handle it again. But I guess yay it is my last year lolI also have some online friends, and I have been kind of distancing myself from them. Part of it is that I do not really feel like talking to anyone, and another part of it is because I feel super left out. Sometimes I catch myself getting upset or angry, even though I am not there? Maybe I am mad because I do not really get attention, I just wish people would care about me yknow? Sometimes I catch myself going out my way to get someone is attention, or like do something I know that my friends like? Idk what to call it, sometimes I feel so left out, but it is also my fault I guess I feel left out? Idk man, I have not even been talking to anyone at all, I just wish someone would reach out to me and ask how I am doing. But if I reach out to someone I feel like a huge bother, and my thoughts go racingIdk things right now are strange, I am about to enter adult life and I am scared as fuck, I cannot imagine being by myself or doing adult things. I cannot even imagine myself being successful at that, I feel like I am going to get no where if I am being honest with you I am convinced the way I will die will be me ending my life",Depression

Pissed in bottles to avoid leaving my room, ate 1 sandwich a day, got high, and listened to music. I did not care about anything.

20750,"I dealt with depressing now for 40 years. Only started seeking therapy since 2010. It took me a long time time to admit and accept that I had Clinny D. I always viewed it as a weakness, a flaw in my character. That is until one day I found myself in a locked, darkened room at work, curled up in the fetal position suffering from an anxiety attack. That cannot happen, not in my profession. that is what drove me to seek help. Two therapists and three different antidepressants later, I realized that I had the answer all along. You see, I am an introvert, an INFP to be exact. That means I spend a lot of time thinking, a *lot* of time, like every second of every day. it is like my brain is seeking information, to be challenged, and if it does not get it, it starts to think of other things. that is where my problems lie; I think *too* much. Let to its own devices, my mind starts thinking about the past, about the mistakes I made, the pain of being teased, taunted, and ostracized. I need to keep my mind occupied. that is when it struck me; I need to keep busy doing things that occupy my brain so that it cannot think of anything else but the task at hand. So now, in order to keep it distracted, I *do* things, like clean the house, mow the lawn, clear the yard, work on clearing it the garage so I can get my Camaro in, doing Sudoku. Anything that requires me to think, plan, improvise, solve. And guess what? It works. It really works. I hope some people here will find this piece of advice helpful. You do not need to be excellent at something, or even good. Just find something that will challenge and occupy your brain. Do a jigsaw puzzle, chop wood, calculate the air speed of an unladen swallow (big Asian and European). Any thing. Give it a try, a *real* try, and see what happens. Best of luck to everyone.

My earliest memories are of my father coming home drunk and high. Beating my mother. I would hide under the bed and play dolls with my sister. So she would not hear him beating her. I always wanted friends but never had any. I was the weird kid. I could not go into anyone's house unless invited. I remember peeing my pants outside the door because I was not invited in. I remember my father living 20 minutes down the road but never being there. Only holidays to look good in front of his parents. I remember my mother's family hating me. Telling me I would be just like him. How men are worthless. My stepfather beating me. How they would blame me and say I was lying. I remember being kicked out of the house while still in school for defending her when he raised a fist at her. Hitting him. Making him cry for his mom. I am not a good person I get it. I remember being homeless. I remember meeting my wife at my second job. Breaking into my grandparents house while they were gone for the winter. Drinking too much because I just wanted it to stop and the blackouts gave me peace. I remember the few years of happiness I had with my wife. Well as close to as someone like me can have. I remember us going to school and planning a future. I was going to be a chef. She wanted to be a writer. I remember the knock on my door. Hearing she was not ok. The hospital. Seeing her. Them telling me to call her family. Calling them. Not knowing what to say. She got a headache at work. She just started crying after sitting down and passed out they said. They sent her to a bigger better hospital. I remember driving there. I drove so fast. Reckless. They took her by helicopter. They did tests. I remember they told me she had an aneurysm. She was brain dead. Them asking me to sign papers to have her unplugged. To donate her organs. Her brother wanting her father to see her again. Her father that molested her. That molested more than her. Went to prison for it. I remember stalling so he could see her. I do not know if that was the right thing to do. I hated him. But she was his daughter. And for some reason it was important to her brother. I remember he was not supposed to touch her. I remember him touching her anyways. I remember breaking. I was already broken. I have been bipolar my whole life. I remember signing the papers to take her off life support. Not being able to be there when she passed. It was too much. I apologize. I was a kid. I could only handle so much. I was 23. I killed her with the stroke of a pen. You can say she was brain dead and already dead. But that was what ended it. I remember getting mail that told me about how her organs saved lives. Calling her family, even her father to them. I do not remember the next few years well. I drank a lot. I was trying to kill myself. I stayed with her family some and mine. I made unforgivable mistakes. I got angry. I came close to killing. I remember pulling a knife. I was going to commit suicide by cop. I remember the multiple times I tried to get help. I remember giving up. Going to a group home. Just hoping. I would get help. Trying so many medications. Counseling. Being left to rot. I spent near a decade there. I tried anything they offered. I failed me. They failed me as well. Never following through. Promising things that never happened. The group home was infested with bed bugs and cockroaches. Covered in bites always. My roommates all needed help that none of us got. I was jumped and had teeth broken out for being mistaken for one that was a sexual offender. After years of trying I had to leave as another was bringing weapons into the house. we would drink together. he would pull out one.

16449,"28 male here. This is something I never felt comfortable about talking to anyone about it in person as I do get emotional about it too much. I have had suicidal thoughts over the years, never brought myself to go through with it but they still linger in the back of my mind. First time was when I was in year 10 at school. All through my young life I was bullied physically and verbally. By that point I just felt completely shit about myself, felt that I had no friends, did not deserve any friends and did not deserve to live anymore. Ended up writing a letter stating how I was feeling and passed it onto one of the guys in my class. Later on that day I was on the top floor of the school walking towards the balcony area under the skylight. My intention was to climb over the barrier, jump from what would have been in effect 6 stories up and aim for the metal plate on the bottom floor.I never got there as my English Teacher called me into her classroom for a chat. Turned out she had been informed about the letter I wrote and she gave me one big pep talk which helped me to feel a bit better about myself and snap back to reality. She never knew that she had just stopped me from jumping.A few years later after I turned 19, I went into the Army. Started developing problems with my knees during basic but managed to complete it. Got to trade training and was really struggling due to my knee problems along with other things. Eventually it got to the point when each time I walked into the accomodation block and looked up to the top floor balcony, I just kept imagining myself hanging from the balcony with paracord around my neck.The knee problems continued and after a few months, I was told that I was going to be recommended for a medical discharge by the doctor. I was completely devastated by this as it was the first job I ever had and I was now going to lose it. I broke down in the medical centre and had to get picked up by one of the training staff from the camp who did provide some comfort. Later on I smuggled a large bottle of Jack Daniels into my room (no alcohol allowed in the block btw) and my intention was to down the whole thing in an attempt to kill myself that way. Again, never went through with and ended up sharing it with some of the lads when we had a trip to the beach.Left the Army in 2014 and since then, I have had a logistics job, done an apprenticeship in Fabrication and Welding and now employed as a semi-skilled fabricator. So been working on myself a lot other the years. But every so often, I have felt crap about myself and hating myself for my past decisions. And on those occasions, a voice pops into myself telling me ""why carry on? Just grab the length of rope you got in the car, go into the woods round the back of your house and just go hang yourself!"" But, there is another voice, a feminine one telling me ""no do not that. you are still doing alright. Just keep going"" and that one always wins.I have no desire to end myself as I know I have still got plenty of opportunities and time to sort myself out and better myself. But I just keep getting haunted by these dark thoughts on occasions and they bring me to tears every time. But somehow I have been able to just stuck it up, dust myself off and soldier on day by day. Dark thoughts from long ago haunt me",Depression
10997,Posting this for myself. To hold myself accountable and to let things go into the ether. I have been in a depressive hole for the past 2 years and have been working on the journey out but keep getting knocked down by life and my own bad habits. I take medication and do talk therapy every week. But I also smoke weed everyday which at this point feels like its almost counteracting all the work meds and therapy have been doing. I feel myself ashamed of my life and hating myself. I just wish I did not have to be conscious. I have been having invasive thoughts of self harm and wondering what would happened if I disappeared from this world. I have a few friends that I hold close and are there for me which I am so grateful for. But this thing inside me keeps wanting to kill me. I know they are just thoughts and everything will be fine.

Because I feel like it is only hiding the problem and I have read so much horror stories about medication. Also every story that I have read about people that were happy about their medication they only took it for like ~1 week/2/3 months and they are saying that it helps but I never see a story about someone who is not in the beginning of taking if.

24099,I guess I have always felt like this. Ever since I can remember I get random outbursts of wanting/ having to get out of the place I am in. I have moved so many times I have lost count yet no place ever feels like home. The few people who have felt like that I drive away with my sadness. And the ones who stick around only seem to hurt me. I turned 27 this year and I feel more lost than I ever have. I keep quitting jobs and isolating myself/ pushing people away seem to be the only hobbies I am consistent with. Would therapy help at this point? I have tried that so many times. Antidepressants make me more depressed and keeping sober is the only thing keeping me sane at this point bc self medicating turns into escapism real quick for me. I have reached out to close friends and family as well but all I get is the pep talk. Only temporary it will get better just a phase that happens to everyone every once in a whileThe thing is I know I am not special. I know there is so many people out there who have it worse. Just thinking about it sends me through a guilty black hole of self pity and contempt for my lack of control over my own emotions. When will I stop feeling this emptiness?

I think people would generally describe me as someone with a sense of humour and as having good spirits. I am able to joke and laugh, tell people I am feeling great. But I have a dark side that nobody knows because I don't want to share, as I don't want to be a burden. Usually I am able to keep the feelings away, maintain the facade and stay strong and reasonably happy. But recently, things have not been going well for me, and I think what little resilience I had got washed away.

It is becoming hard for me to stay positive, because I feel so numb inside. I am becoming less motivated to do things that I enjoyed only a couple weeks ago. I don't want to socialise anymore. I have work piling up to the point that I am completely overwhelmed, but don't feel sharp enough or motivated enough to make a start to it.  I was drifting between two friend groups, and lost one of them because I decided to prioritise the other. I feel disconnected from my family and friends, mainly because they are currently so far away. I have a bad relationship with my father, who I feel like does not care for me anymore after he started a new family. I hate the way I act, and am consumed by guilt and embarrassment when I think about my words or actions. A romantic situation I was involved with for only a month imploded, and I can't stop blaming myself, can't stop thinking about it or fully letting go.

One day I feel happy and I think, there was absolutely nothing wrong with me lol I was so dramatic, and boom comes the weeks of depression and being angry with everything and everyone. Being out of control with my emotions but feeling empty and numb at the same time. I cannot sleep, and then I cannot wake up. When I finally fall asleep I can stay there forever. When I am down, I do not WANT to get better. I roll my eyes at all that you need to be POSITIVE, its a mindset crap. I do not care. But when I am okay, I am advocating for that and motivated to improve my life. I think I am constantly in the middle of self improvement and self destruction. I do not want to go out anymore or see other people, and sometimes I feel all the relationships I have around me are all fake. My friends probably secretly hate me and look down on me. My boyfriend probably thinks those girls in porn are much prettier and better than me. I am the failure of the family with no good career, money, or knowledge of the world. I cannot talk stocks and policies like my brother. And I have nothing I am really good at either. I can learn but I have no motivation either. My family will think I am an idiot anyways that is how its always been. I often find myself wanting to restart. Have a clean slate, everything is brand new and I feel normal. But I do not have the resources or willpower for that. And sometimes I just wish I never existed, I wish I can disappearessentially die without the pain and consequences on others around me. After a decade now being depressed on and off, I realize that I should probably try some medication. I have been weary of trying it but probably its worth a shot?

I am just starting over and now she is wondering why I am hiding my grades from her. &amp; I have lied about my grades every since I started failing/was on academic probation in college. I feel like a POS. I do not know what to do. She says if I do not get in a call with a school academic advisor and discuss why I did not get into the state university here WITH HER, she will not be paying for any more school. I am fucking fucked. Long story short, I got my depression handled this last year also but she only knows about the eating disorder. She is NOT the type to be sympathetic about me failing because I had depression, so telling her that is a no. All of the people I know my age have graduated and have degrees w/ a path/future, and I am still here at phase 1, but minus a ton of money. I work for all of my money I have, but my family does not have a lot to spare and my dad does not believe in education &amp; has told me every time I see him that he will never help.

But they would not understand If I talk to them honestly due to the culture I live in, they probably do not believe mental issues are real and would look down on me for opening up. They keep comparing me to my peers who are getting married and finding good jobs, which is making the whole situation worse for me. I am envious of those people who are able to keep their life in check when dealing with those things, and I despise myself for how lazy I am, I keep starting each year saying this; this year I am going to put in the work for real, and I get lost somewhere along the way and nearly at the end I think to myself where did it all go wrong? I still had hope because I am young and always thought to myself that yeah life sucks now but it will get better at some point, I guess It partially did some issues like self-image, but I was never consistently happy, I probably need to accept that this is something that is going to stay with me as long as I live.No one knows about my struggles, I put on ""everything is normal"" mask socially. With family, I am quite loved, I joke around a lot and bring good energy I think. And so I would never kill myself because I know how many this would hurt. I do not want to die either, but sometimes I wish I was never born and do have moments of suicidal ideation which is draining.Having no one to talk to about this for years now has begun to become physically painful, so this is my attempt to potentially relieve a bit of the pain.

He said to my mother until I apologize for my actions he is going to stop taking care of me (dental needs, doctors appointments, etc.) My mom does not believe in medication and I am not really a fan either, but since bipolar has been pointed out to me the hallucinations, paranoia, insomnia, impulsive decisions, and suicide attempts, make sense because of the dramatic shifts in my moods a few times a year. I believe I am manic at the moment because my decision making gets waaaaay more fucked up than usual and I am loud, fast talking, energized, and have not slept for more than 5 hours a night and now I am not sleeping at all regardless of 9 hours shifts at work. I only have insight now because it happened to me so many times. I am really irritable at my mother because I have to be like this because until I am 18 I have no say in my care. She does not believe in medicine and I do not like medicine either but I do not want to be like this anymore. She calls me dramatic when I feel like I am going through hell in my mind. Everyone just feels the need to call me a bitch:Me: *Did not sleep AT ALL after closing at work and when I almost had a remote chance at sleeping my niece starts screaming her head off*My sister: *who recently shit on me for crying about a recent miscarriage I had at a baseball game and asking to go home when she wanted to see fucking BIG AND RICH (lmao) literally yelled at me the whole time for asking to leave in front of zillions of people starts hissing at me and blaming me for waking up her child when she was clearly already awake and screaming when I got up*Me: *Pissed because of this*My sister: ""you are SUCH A BITCH!"" Then there is my mom:Me: *exhausted but cannot sleep due to the episode*My mom: ""Take out the garbage.""Me: ""Okay.""My mom: ""I said do it now! I do everything around here and you just lay there.""Me:*did not sleep after work, just hates life in general and does not want to react the way I do but she keeps freaking out* ""IT WILL GET DONE I PROMISE YOU!""My mom: ""You always say that. You always have to have things done your way."" *Proceeds to threaten to call my dad or someone to yell at me*Me:*Yells expletives out of extreme anger, starts screaming and covering ears because of sensory overload, and BEGS her to leave me alone because NOTHING would be more relieving at that point*My mom: *Walks away* ""you are so dramatic.""My mom does not get that I have a disease in my brain. She makes me live like this and it makes me so angry when she says stuff like that.My dad in a nutshell: *Is bipolar himself, narcissistic, and blackmails me for taking care of me*I hate it when people try to tell me that it is because I am ""a teenager"" I want those people to go to hell. I have tried to die 3 times, cannot function without a stimulant, lost a child, was shit on for having feelings about it, have abandonment issues because of my dad leaving when I was one, forcing me to be in this world with these problems and then replacing me AND HE STILL does not LET US FORGET! LOL (not to mention people who have called me a mess and left and used me on a romantic level), have three current diagnoses already, and if I express myself I get called a bitch or ""Somebody has it worse""I am done.I feel like genuinely crying but my moods will not let me. I deal with manic episodes and I am called dramatic by my mother who will not let me go on medication *Not as long of a story as it looks*",Depression

24935,"TW-deathI honestly cannot grasp it. it is my boyfriends step dad, and I knew him personally. I am waiting for someone to just tell me ""haha it is a prank! they are actually just staying somewhere else for a while."" I knew this person who passed away. He was an abusive(emotionally too) drunk to his wife. I am so used to being scared of who is opening the door, and that if it is them what are they going to tell, what are they going to do? I am so used to locking to door in case they come into the room and break something. I am so used to worrying about his wifes safety. He isolated himself in his workshop. He was the only person other than his son to have the key for it. Today, I was out with his wife, and his wife's friend, and one of her sons (she as three, and one girl). We went to go get tabs and a license plates for one of her cars that was not in use and did not have plates because her husband took them off. her husband took away her keys to her main car, and bank cards. (He let her keep the capital one with 3,000 limit, but it was used so maybe like 1,500-800?) When we came back to the house, and went to the back of the house near the shop there were police, and an ambulance. His son found him after checking on him, since we told everyone he isolated himself on the 4th of July. His mother said he is no longer alive. We later found out he must have been drunk (he had no food in the shop, had tons of alcohol, and stayed in there for two days, PLUS no water), slipped, and fell on his head, bleed out and died. After this, everyone was more lively, and his kids were not worried about anything. Yes everyone was sad, but his kids were more social. When he used to be around they would not come out of their rooms except for dinner. The two kids who have rooms down stairs would stock up snacks from the kitchen when he was around, and stayed in their rooms since there was a bathroom down there. The other two kids would do the same, and only come out to use the bathroom that is it. His wife did not love him, and did not want to be with him, we were planning on getting a OFP, but she did not wish death upon him, only to get him away so he cannot emotionally or physically harm her. I still have a feeling he is out in the shop, or that I am dreaming. I cannot grasp this is real either. I still feel like he is going to go back and forth from the shop and the house with a bottle of sailor Jerry's cradled in his arm, and yell at his wife that she is a piece of shit, and that he hates her. But, all of this abuse has now come to a stop. She can now progress with her life, and find someone who is a lot better for her. I also feel like I am not allowed to cry, because my mother said I cannot feel sad for the death of others if their not family. I kept blanking out when we came to the back of the house. The scene of everything happening. For the first time ever, I experienced someone die in my life, and I felt what it is like.",Depression

I have always been kind of skinny, but this makes me hate myself even more. i try to exercise and eat but i lack appetite and interest in food, and my body feels like bricks most of the time, so its incredibly hard to motivate myself to exercise. all i want is to just love myself more, but i cannot. everything around me in the world seems so harmful and i just feel so scared and hopeless in a world like this. i wish i could go back to the easier times. I have even had some days where i ate pretty well and even ate some snacks. i would feel confident and happy with myself. next week i would go and weigh myself being sure i must have gained some, and........ silence. lost weight again. it completely destroys that bit of confidence i had and makes me feel so upset. i do not know if I am asking for advice rn or if i just felt like sharing this, but anyone reading this, thank you. keep losing weight unintentionally.",Depression

So not sure if that is part of my trauma. ik I am not as strong as some people but that def added to part of my trauma.. anyways i developed a social anxiety and generalized anxiety disorder which hindered my ability to make friends, so i had like 3 friends max.. i only talked to them sometimes too, not even close friends because of my anxiety and lack of motivation. i would spend all day playing on my laptop when i was a bit younger because it was an escape for me. I could just avoid my life and play video games all day because my parents are lenient. I started developing a depressive disorder, probably because i also started smoking weed about a gram a day of some strong dispensary weed for about 3/4 of a year. My brain was fucked i could not think at all, could not concentrate on anything for more than like a minute, hell i could not even concentrate or remember like anything from like the past day or two.. I was contemplating just starving myself to death because i did not know what the fuck to do but i realized that there is other ways.. not at the time.. but now.. i got a nurse practitioner who gave me Citalopram(antidepressant ssri), and recommended counselling and i accepted the counselling at the time. I declined later on when i got a phone call from the receptonist to make a counselling appointment or whatever, because i thought i was feel better, and i was. the side effects sucked. no sex drive really and insomnia. then i started smoking about a gram a day again which in about 5 days i went into a psychosis and got extremely anxious, agitated, panicky, and even yelled at my parents and told my mom to fuck off because she thought it was just anxiety and i knew it was not. Anyways she was broken inside because of her anxiety disorder and she could not handle it. I am out of psychosis now and looking into antidepressants again with something to help me sleep.

Doing nothing is so needed...People, if you go to work every day feeling like shit, crying during work hours, you should talk to whoever supports you and discuss about taking time off. Be responsible about it, but take advantage if you can do it. I have an office job, which of course makes it easier as I am not my own boss.

i’m now surrounded by lovely people but they’re all leaving the city for summer break. i can’t stop worrying that i’ll become depressed again. my plan for now is to take summer courses and pick up a campus job (e.g. working at the library). perhaps i’ll pick up a casual part-time job as well. i just want to make sure that i keep myself busy. last summer was tough cause i didn’t have the means to meet people and interact, and i’m hoping this time it’ll be different if i put myself out there. honestly though, i just can’t help but worry a lot. depression is my worst enemy and it lives inside me. at this point, i can’t let it fucking win again.

8057,"I identify myself as introvert. Since I have been exposed to internet from year 2016 I have always found comfort in reading about Psychology. I am fascinated by MBTI, Big 5 Models, Jungian Typology and all the things along the lines. I have focused very much on self improvement and tried to improve my skills. I figured out atleast acting like an extrovert tends to make social life a hell lot easier. But whenever I try to do this I just do not feel like myself. I kind of become numb among people which I only realise when I let myself speak to me often at night when alone. I think forcing myself to socialise and talking to friends is kind of helping in building my social persona but I just live by a philosophy that everyone is just alone in his life and as long as I do not fall into making myself vulnerable in front of people I am fine. I just do not want anyone to know the real me. And I guess the reason for that is because I have experienced and now firmly believe too that no one can ever understand me fully. I have tried explaining myself to people but I feel every friend/family I ever had just waited for their turn to speak if I ever talk about myself. Anyways the question is I am confused what part is me ?Should I keep myself happy and just keep living in my head and stop interacting to other humans. Because I literally just love living by myself. Or I should keep trying to socialise because I also believe that if I want to earn even a small amount of money I need to just develop my social game. Keep in mind every other human being including my family is just a person to me whom I can just never reveal my true self (talking about things I want) because whenever I have done it in my life people just go blank like it is a huge lot complex for them even to comprehend and believe me I have tried this way many times than you can imagine.

10308,"Hello everyone, i was reading a lot of your stories and i always wanted to post something but never did because i did not want to bother anyone and i felt that i did not deserved any attention.But in some extreme efforts to try to get better, i convinced myself to do it, so here i am.Since i Can remember, i always had a lot of depression phases 2/3 times a year, but i was at maximum a month. Unfortunately, i had a big trauma in 2017, an since then, I am depressed all day. I tried some medication in a short period of Time (2 months) but i could not recognize myself as i take it. I was miserable, could not do anything and when i realized i go panic attacks that made it worth. And even After that, when i tried to stop medication, i could not stop right away because of the weaning time. So now I am scared of that but i still feel, it is the only solution.I am followed by a psychiatrist and a psychologist, so I am not on my own. Also, even if it is like carrying a Mountain, i made my life proper again. I start a formation in september in alternation, I am in a relationship and everything is going well, and he understands and help me with this, I am getting my driver license (which was hard to start because of traumatism younger) .... So it is really good ! But the more i try to move forward in life, the more i feel bad.My brain feels foggy, my heart hurts me everytime, i wake up everyday only wanting to end me and my day and i needs so much effort not to have any rewards. Everything is worst than before. I am doing sport every two days, I am forcing myself to have some sociabilisation, I am good looking, I am still clever.... But i cannot be happy and it feels like there is nothing i cannot do at this point. Even worse, people just tell me that they do not know why i feel so miserable while i got everything for me. I feel guilty not to be better, and it sadden me even more. it is an awful loop where I am in and .... I do not know how to just resist again and again, having less and less energy and being a hundreth of what i was ...Sorry for this long story, i really do not want to be a burden and i Hope that every people that come here just go better One step forward, two stepbacks",Depression

15666,"Hi! I will be as brief as possible and I will try to lay this out clearly. Thank you so much for taking the time to read my post!Background: I am going through rather a hard time at the moment. I had to take off work until September due to severe depression, which I have suffered with for about 7 years now. It came to a head last year, when my pretty horrible boyfriend of nearly a decade finally left me. This is the first time I have ever had to go on ""sick leave,"" and I hate it. I am so, so lucky that I have this option, but I still feel embarrassed and frustrated that it is come to this point. Problem: I have been seeing a psychologist and he always tells me to make friends. he is been harping on it for the last few weeks and this last Friday he gave it to me as my ""homework,"" for our next session. Truth be told I really, really want a good friend because I have never actually had one before. My problem is that I have already *tried* to make new friends, and it went horribly. Back in February he gave me a similar piece of ""homework,"" and I ended up emailing some people I know pretty well from work and church. I worked hard on the emails, personalized them, and I had really high hopes when I sent them out. Hopes which were dashed when nobody responded to any of the emails. I feel crazy admitting this, but this put me in a pretty horrible state for a while and really killed what was left of my self esteem. I honestly do not think I will ever be ready to do that again, because another rejection like that could actually kill me. I do, however, recognize that I have to pull myself back up and try again if I ever want to get better.Question: What is the safest way for a very sensitive, sad woman to make friends? Is there any way to reach out to people with less risk of rejection? All the mental health websites I can find recommend ""reaching out to people,"" or ""making friends"" but none of them tell me what to do in the event that nobody wants to be my friend. I am just really, really scared of being rejected again. What is the safest way for a very depressed woman to make new friends?",Depression

11285,"I am M/nearly 22 (because I am born December 1999) (also I am ashamed of my depression because it is unmanly)0 I have been living with depression since 2012 where it got worse every year until 2015 where I had multiple failed suicide attempts (not really manly, I know). After that it now comes in episodes. Sometimes these episodes are extreme (like right now because I have lost a family, people on tumblr spread false information about me, witch hunt me, I am all alone and I am getting doxxed), medium or mild. Also there is my dysphoria and paranoia mixed up in this as well. Before I tell you my whole life story I keep it short: Yes, I have been to a psychologist but it is not possible due to Covid at the moment. And I never had any friends in my life as people rather liked to bully me and physically hurt me (that is why I am glad I am out of school for so many years now) and almost got me killed once by throwing me in front of a bus. Anyways I noticed that my eyesight got worse and worse over the years. Can it be because of depression or because I stay up all night (I am very nocturnal) for years now? I had a sharp crisp eyesight a few years ago where I couldf see details 10m away but now I cannot even Identify faces anymore from one meters. (sorry for using the metric system, I am not american) I am scared to go blind. Additonal Note: My hearing is actually my greatest strenght and the only sense left that is close to superhuman as proven by multiple tests in the past that I took.

Hopeless, worthless, a failure and dissapointment to everyone around me who has tried to help and may think that I'm fine not knowing what is going on in my head for fear of criticism or pity, I hate myself. I've fully accepted death although this is not a suicide note or an indication of one, I have previously attempted and for awhile felt no remorse or regret from doing so. And even now I wish I would've given it 100% as I feel I have no use or purpose and all I ever do is dissappint both myself and others, I am worthless. Nothing I jave ever done is fulfilling past the honeymoon phase of finding a new hobby, I never have the drive or discipline to keep at it I see the mountain I have to climb and it all seems so pointless to me. And I am left a failure again until I decide to do something else and fail once again. I don't deserve anything I have or anyone that is friends with me.

I only ask people how they are if they seem to not be in a good mood and I would actually care to find out what's wrong. Someone might say ""what if they may not seem sad but still have something wrong with them?"" Then that most likely means that they are hiding it and that they would rather not talk about it (like many of us).

I can get excited about a new game, tear up for a sad movie, laugh at a joke, and even smile when something good is happening. it is just, these feelings, these emotions, they come as suddenly as they disappear. Because these feelings fade away so quickly, I often find myself seeking out new material to stimulate my emotions, be it a good book, a new game, or a sad movie. But it really sucks, because even when I am doing this, I easily lose interest, and end up having to start something new way before I even come close to finishing what I just started. Yet despite this, I cannot stop, because if I do not do this, I feel like I am simply just breathing and not actually living.

Felt that hopeless despair and apathy. Rock bottom.The depths to which my depression could truly sink was discovered two weeks ago. There was no catalyst for this change, everything simply got completely unmanageable. My current mental state is much worse than I could have ever imagined possible. Every minute of every day feels like physical pain. No brief moments of relief what so ever. Nothing can distract me. No desire to continue on. I always used to pride myself on being strong in the face on my depression, that suicide was never an option, not for me. In these past two weeks my suicidal ideation has been strong. Thinking of family and loved ones no longer steers me clear of this option. This is truly a scary place to be, and I fear I am losing myself entirely.

I want to feel something other than inadequacy and pitifulness.Over the past few days I have come to the fact that I have an eating disorder, and I have been living with it for probably a little over 2 years and it has gotten progressively worse with age. I have also been thinking about how I talk to others. I have realised that I am too nice and I let people walk all over me, or I let mean comments pass by. I have decided I am not going to do that anymore, and when someone says something that I do not agree with, I am going to stand up for myself. I feel like a fraud. I feel like I am putting on thus facade to people to please people. Because I must admit it without being vain, I am...different than most people. I dress weird, I like old music, I am wiser than my fellow sixteen year old peers and I am a lot more articulate than my peers and that is probably because I read the classics and enjoy poetry. I am an intellectual person and in my family I am a black sheep, because everyone around me is a lot more shallow than I when speaking about topics and they just like different things than me. So when I am around other people, it is better not to speak than to say something that does not fit their norm and be laughed at and made fun of. To be honest, I would rather be alone than be in a group of people who share no interests than me. To me, that is probably the worst thing to deal with...people you just do not click with.

21045,"I grew up in suburban Tennessee, in a borderline fundamentalist Christian community. My childhood was extremely comfortable, happy, and sheltered. I love my parents, they are genuinely caring, funny, enjoyable people. I never really acted out and I always did well in school. Never once did I fear for my future or worry about what was going to happen to me in adulthood. When I was a senior in high school, I started to act out. I had a disrespectful, rude boyfriend. Looking back, I fully understand why my parents did not like him, but he was my first boyfriend and teenage me was blinded by how much I loved him. While we were dating, a tried weed and we had s\*x, but like most normal teenagers I kept this from my parents. One day, my dad happened upon a fairly explicit text from him, and I was told to immediately stop dating him. I refused. This continued repeatedly throughout my senior year, with threats to not send me off to college and constant yelling/crying matched between them and I about why god disapproves of me and why it was hurting them so much that I was s\*xually active. I eventually lied to them and told them I broke up with my boyfriend. The summer between senior year and college, I saw him secretly all the time. I was constantly lying. It felt horrible, but I was so dumb and in love I did it anyway. I regret this time in my life a lot. I went off to college somewhere far away (majored in music) and even then my dad was reading my texts. He read one about me going to smoke weed with some friends, and immediately cut me off. I started to strongly believe I needed to be independent. I never asked for help from my parents. I got a job and worked almost everyday between classes my entire freshman year. I paid for everything but my tuition. Although I was proud of myself for this at the time, It started a pattern that i could not reverse. It felt like I could not tell my parents anything for fear of losing them and losing the only real support system I had. I would not give them intimate details about my life anymore. I would not tell them when I was sad. I would not tell them when I would go to the doctor. I would not tell them when I got a diagnosis. I would not tell them if I was going to therapy. I only ever told them the positives. I would tell them if I would achieved something, or just had a normal, happy day. This worked for me for a long time. During college, I worked enough that I never had to ask for anything. I had my moments of sadness or worry, but I was happy knowing my life was stable. I broke up with my deadbeat boyfriend eventually, which was for the best, and suddenly my parents were proud of me again. The summer between my sophomore and junior years (age 20), I stayed with my parents and interned at a music company. I had a rough summer because I started randomly hooking up with guys (which was not my thing) and I had to get my appendix removed which brought on several complications. My parents knew I was up to something all the time and started treating me coldly again. The withdrew their normal, funny, friendly selves and barely interacted with me. By this time I was tired of arguing with them, so I just did not confront them about it. But even so, they enforced an 11 o clock curfew on me, and still occasionally bemoaned that I was not a Christian. This perpetuated the belief I already held, which was that my parents' hospitality towards me was conditional. It relied on me conforming to their idea of me. When I went back to school in the fall, the distance made things better. I started dating my current boyfriend, who I obviously could sleep with and hang out with and do anything with without my parents knowing, so they were in the dark, and perfectly happy about our relationship. My junior was incredibly happy. I had a boyfriend I loved, and my parents treated me like they were proud of me. Senior year came along and I began to consider my life after graduation. My boyfriend and I planned to move in together with a few of our friends as well. We were going to move to LA. This idea settled in the back of my mind during school, and then became the focus when I graduated. I came back to my parents' house this summer (I am 22 and I graduated in May) and the plan is to leave for Los Angeles at the end of July. I have been applying for jobs constantly. Incessantly. I wanted so badly to get a job before I told my parents I was moving in with my boyfriend. I have worked day in and day out and I have not received a single email back. I understand this is how the music industry is, but my fear of moving out there and having no help from my parents at all because they do not believe in living with someone before you are married is enormous. My dad once told me that if I moved in with a boyfriend I better be able to completely support myself because I could not expect any help from him. I am exhausted by the amount of work I have done at this point, and completely emotionally drained by the fact that I have no acceptances or denials, just radio silence. I have become so obsessive and stressed about it that my entire brain is consumed. I cannot be distracted. I cannot even sleep well. I am a gigantic disappointment to myself, even though I know the industry I am trying to get into has very high barriers to entry. I have never in my life had no job, no school, and no purpose. My parents still treat me differently because I am not a Christian. I do not go to church with them (because of a particular incident where I ran out crying because the sermon was about homosexuality and sex before marriage). My mom barely talks to me on these days. I have stopped exercising and eating healthily completely. I am on my phone an ungodly amount. I cry everyday and spend the other parts either applying to jobs or laying in bed looking at meaningless crap on instagram. I have an extremely low tolerance for stress now. I can become debilitatingly anxious at the drop of a pin. I do not think I am the same person to my friends or my boyfriend. I am not as funny or lighthearted, I am really easily socially exhausted. I just want to be better. I want to be kind to people and be a great friend and a great girlfriend. I really desperately want a close relationship with my family, but I am so scared of losing them if I am too honest. I cannot tell how much of my depression is situational and how much of it is something more chronic... and I cannot tell which option I should attempt to remedy first.

I was dating my girlfriend for about 9 months and over the last couple of months I really messed everything up. I have been continuously pushing her away in all types of ways such as: having little to no sex drive because I have had no ability to even think about that, I have been isolating myself and not communicating what I have been going through well, and I just have not wanted to go on dates. None of this is why she said she wanted to break up though, she wanted to break up because I have not been able to make myself talk to her or communicate while we are back from school. She said I have a lot I need to work on and that she does too.Anyway I agree with her and I know I should not be in a relationship right now but I love her so much and want to be with her so bad, so this is not a post where I want you guys to say we should not be together right now because I know this. I think we will eventually get back together if she can see I grew up. I do not want to work on myself for her to take me back but that would be a positive.I guess me making this post is to ask how have you guys been able to work on yourself and what are some methods I can use to improve my mental stability, and also how have you been able to refind yourself when you have no clue who you are anymore?

19288,"You need to love yourself, sincerely. Stop depending on others for what you can provide. Once you do, the pain is experienced differently. Feel the 'negative' energy and welcome it with open arms. Let it stay as long as it wants, It does not harm you, but you harm yourself trying to get rid of it. If there are times when negative thoughts of interactions flood your mind accept that your harsh judgement could be correct. You might have done something stupid. You may have been awkward. It only matters if you say it does. Without your consent, nobody can define what is 'good' in your existence. that is your power.When you depend on others for your image and worth, you have to constantly change yourself to fit their definition of good. You trade your life for the affection of another and they have no idea what they are doing here. It becomes the blind leading the blind. Spend time with yourself. Not watching tv or reading a book. Stand up and slowly move your toes, bend your knees slightly and flex your lower body. Feel what it is like to let your muscles take the pressure off your bones. Turn on some music and allow the connection between sound and touch to go unfiltered. Make up your own vocals. Let the blood and oxygen flow and your nerves come alive. Hear what they say.Many abuse their bodies, treating it like a slave to their will. it is a foundational part of existence. Spend time with it and it will enhance your experience. When lying in bed, shut everything off and slowly curly your hands and toes. Tense them in the motion. Feel each movement. This is it. This is your experience of existence. Grab each second of it and appreciate it. If you believe you could create a better one, you have the power to do so. The rules of meaning and purpose are all written in your mind. If it is difficult, use that knowledge to empathize with existence. it is malleable, but it is not going to shape itself to your will. You need to connect with it. Not with the voices of others, with yourself. You. You exist. you are incredible. do not let anyone lie to you and if they are telling you their truth, then know that they do not see what this is.

18779,"Hi everyone. I am a 23 year old male nurse that has been working for three years now. I was diagnosed with Major Depression while I was in High School along with anxiety, and Tourette Syndrome. I have been battling suicidal thoughts ever since then and I have been hospitalized at an inpatient psychiatric facility three times. I cannot remember if being inpatient actually helped me though. I have been receiving electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) for a little over a year and have had two acute series done. The ECT has ruined my memory and it does not seem to be helping any longer. I had a treatment done on Monday and was already feeling severely depressed and suicidal by Tuesday night. I do not know what to do.I could commit myself again, but my brother's white coat ceremony is coming up and I need my PTO to be able to fly out there to see it. I also do not want my family to worry. I love them and they are the only reason that I have not killed myself yet. I also do not even know if its worth it. I have been inpatient three times already and the suicidal thoughts are still there. I do have a couple of good things going on in my life though. I have a great job and a extremely loving family that is almost always willing to put up with a call from me because I know it helps my depressed mood. I have told everyone that I talk to regularly (my brother, sister, aunt, uncle, Dad, and Mom) that I have been feeling down and that talking to them helps improve my mood. However, I have been struggling with the feeling that I am starting to call them too often. I just do not want to bother them. To make things worse, my therapist is currently on maternity leave. I have a substitute therapist but that just is not the same. On top of my depression, my anxiety is so severe that I am unable to make friends. I have not had a friend since high school and that was only because I was friends with my twin brother's friends. I just get so flustered when I am around people that I can barely talk. I have no work friends, they all just know me as the quiet guy. I do not know. Everything just feels like too much. I am so tired and frustrated. I am just ready for everything to be over. I have feel like I have been suicidal for most of my adult life",Depression

47767,"Constant feeling that I'm doing something wrong. There is a persistent feeling of uneasiness and insecurity that permeates so many of my actions. I feel like somehow, unconsciously, I'm sabotaging my own future. Academically, socially, romantically, it feels like I'm constantly out of the loop on some essential piece of information that's going to come back and bite me in the future and ruin any chances of living a comfortable life. All I really want is to be modestly happy and to have the space to enjoy the few things that make me feel that life is worth living (family, love, reading, cooking, hiking, etc). But there is this never ending feeling of insecurity that I'll never achieve this. I know there are no guarantees and that our future is really out of our hands, but it just gets me down so much knowing that there's a possibility I'll be alone in the future or I'll end up too poor to engage in my passions, or that my life will become an endless stream of meaningless labour and bills, or that I'll reach a point where my opportunities in life have irrevocably passed and I'm trapped in a depressive, meagre existence forever. Probably sounds dramatic, but I just can't help this way of thinking, I always feel like there's something better I could be doing, some area of my life that needs to be optimised, some chain of decisions that once met will lead me to the best possible outcome. At the end of it all it just makes me want to withdraw and give up because of all the pressure.",Depression

First semester of university, totally obsessed and got 90s, second semester no motivation2. Met a girl and starting dating her, we talked nonstop and loved eachother, got bored and lost feelings after 5 months.3.

I cannot see myself dating/marrying for longer than 2 years, being at a job for more than 2 years, etc. I would say my mind is definitely different compared to most people.

I am just taking whatever exams available, and although I passed all of the exams that I took, but I never got to use them at all.I enrolled in law school, but quit after 1 month because its not my passion.I passed the exams to be qualified as a policeman, but never entered the police corps because I had myself a tattoo before I even knew that I passed.Now I am 25 years old and spent the last 2 years as assistant in our family business. I thought I had a career going for me as successor to the family business until yesterday, at my parents reunion with their former colleagues and friends.I drove my parents to the venue of their reunion. My parents introduced me to their friends and soon after they talked about career and work. My dads friends kept bragging about their sons and daughters and how their parenting produced IT experts, licensed engineers, nurse, psychologists, doctors, ship captains, etc.I saw how my parents looked worried about not having to brag to their friends that their only son, at 25, still had no work experience outside of family business, and just lived off a small apartment owned by my parents.Conclusion, I really f*%ked up my life. If I could just turn back time and choose a more practical degree, I might have a professional career already, like the sons and daughters of my parents friends. But here I am, trying to learn and manage a family business because what other options do I have? If I refuse to manage our family business and my parents die or something, I am nothing. Knowledge in business is the only advantage I have left in trying to compete with these young professionals.

I cannot hold down a job, I have no friends, and my family keep me at arms length. My dad tries in his own way but he will never reach out to me, I have to contact him. And if I say I am not good I just get ""oh dear."" My brother also suffers with depression but stopped taking his tablets and thinks himself of some sort of life guru and if you are not living life and have his thought process and opinions he is not interested.

8943,"So I have been feeling this way for, well ages. After a few life changing moments a few years ago I suddenly actually want to stay. A few things kind of magically fell into place for me which made life not seem so bad. do not get me wrong. I absolutely still have those heavy dark days that feel like it will never pass. I am fighting my best fight but I have recently noticed I am slipping back into old habits. For example, I have that nagging feeling that I am just not good enough unless I work myself to the bone, even picking up a second job in the process, and if I do not then I am worthless and not worthy of love. I have resorted to needing sleep aids to have a regular sleep schedule just to be able to keep myself functioning to work 12 hour days 6 days a week. A lot to unpack there but I am kind of ignoring it for now. Today was an ok day, but a coworker who came in for shift change complained loudly and angrily to another coworker near me about how poorly closing was the night before. Small things like securing lids on produce and closing bread bags were missed. I closed last night and of course it was a bad night for me where everything is a blur and my memory is shot so then I began to list off in my head what I did and what I must have forgotten. I became even more upset upon hearing them complain about seeing me and other closers off the clock relaxing at the bar (I work at a tavern) and how no one should have clocked out without a proper walk through. It just so happened to be my birthday which my coworkers found out about and I stayed for a single drink out of feeling obligated to celebrate and I NEVER stay after for a drink because I feel so uncomfortable in social situations. I was close to tears as I hurried to finish up and clock out this afternoon. Am I taking his outburst as validation for how awful I already feel about myself or was my reaction appropriate? Me forgetting something at closing when I am normally very diligent about completing tasks correctly is horrifying for me and now I never want to clock out early again even though my manager let me leave early last night. I just need a little help navigating this situation and how to handle it when my boss confronts me about it next time I clock in, which they definitely will because the complaining coworker has lead to confrontations with my boss in the past. I want to never have to clock in again. I am terrified. Need help navigating uncertainty",Depression

47738,"I'm so sick of university (rant) It's just a constant struggle, the degree isn't even that valuable and I haven't been to my classes for a couple weeks now. I wake up and sit in the shower for an hour, make some food and play games. I have two dissertations due in May along with 3 other assignments, and 2 exams. No one seems to believe I'm depressed, my boyfriend says I'm ""not mentally ill I'm just going through a hard time"", but everyone else handles it better than me. 

I have to work at a bar that's open til 4am on the weekends and I finish work at 5, then a half hour walk back so at the best of times I fall fall at 6. I know that this job is making my mental health worse but I don't have long left at uni now, there's no point in quitting. 

In the UK the government give you a maintenance loan to help pay rent and cover living costs, most people get around £7-9k per year, I get 4k because of my parents income, but they don't even make that much and they can't help me financially. The 4k doesn't even cover the rent for my place so my part time job is paying rent, food, laundry, transport, clothes when I need them etc, and other things. 

I'm managing to save up my money without spending over budget but that's about the only thing that seems worth it, actually making money. With university there is nothing to motivate me other than guilt or shame. My first year of uni was during the pandemic and the second year was heavily affected as well. Third year is just full of strikes, the free university bus never shows up so I miss my classes when I actually try, it's all so demotivating. 

The one time I opened up to a friend properly he distanced himself from me because I didn't text him back for a couple days, and he took it personally, even after I explained everything to him. To be honest, he was a terrible friend anyway, but I'll save you the details. My parents don't understand it, they're in denial that their kid is depressed and anxious, probably because they are too, but my mum always tells me I'm just being silly when I open up, so not much hope there.

I just wish I could sleep through it all. I feel like I have no control over my life at the moment and I feel like a waste of oxygen. I don't know if this would be helpful to anyone, but I hope someone else can relate.",Depression

At first I thought it was burnout from uni....but now I have a feeling that uni was my form of escapism, and now that I am graduated, I just feel like shit. I was an emotional mess back in April, and now I just feel numb. I still overly care about people and important things, but my mood has been so static. I am not happy anymore, I am not sad anymore, I am just....there? I am just so beyond tired. Past 5 years was so intense, with both school and personal stuff. I am an overachiever, my cGPA is a near 4.0, grad school is not too far. Career wise, life is good. I am at my prime, and I feel so confident in that. But in this year alone a close friend and my sibling were both suicidal. First dude I ever truly liked turned out to also be similar, and that led me to being a codependent chaser. My parents barely were able to pay their mortgage due to unemployment. My dads health has been steadily declining. My PCOS has shattered my self image and worth. My sibling and parents fight constantly. My parents fight with each other constantly. What are the fucking odds- every year I tell myself that the next year is going to be better, and I end up disappointing myself. Like, I can never catch a break. And literally I do not know anything about personal boundaries. I am so quick to commit to being there for people, but I have realized that I am never there for myself. Apparently caring too much about others is a trauma response, and that totally makes sense. Being the eldest daughter in a dysfunctional immigrant family, I learned from a young age to set myself aside for others. Being a therapist, peacemaker, tutor, caretaker for my family members and all that. And now- I just feel like I am passing my threshold of tolerance. And what is so fucked up about all of this is that I am on track to becoming a physician- I have to want to care for people. But I know that if I continue like this, I am going to end up probably yeeting myself before I even finish training. I need to be there for myself for a bit, but a night of simple self-care makes me feel beyond guilty. I feel so fucking lonely, but I want to be left alone more than anything.

Socially I never fit, I had occasional friends. I do not remember a time when I was really happy. That was my life before IT happened.A year ago strange things started to happen to me, I would have unusual mood swings. Moment of gratitude and dull moment all in one day. I never had that before usually it is period of euphoria followed by period of melancholia. Now it was happening all in one day. I became mystical, believing God was behind every aspect of my life, every small detail. There are moment I feel OK and there are moment I feel totally lost. I do not understand what is happening to me.I talked to my psychiatrist about it, he suggested an antidepressant. I do not want to take it because I believe somehow the grace of God is in me but I doubt and that is killing me.

I do not have any friends who are likely awake to turn to and its honestly a sensitive matter. I went out with my wife and a friend of hers this evening. During the course of the night the friend revealed that my wife had spoken to her and been less than complimentary about the attractiveness of my ass.A little hurtful, considering she is normally complimentary about it to my face, but no big deal, right? I mean, nobody is perfect.However, when I raise the point that it is not a particularly nice thing to hear, I am met with ""Well I only said that because..."" essentially making it my fault.This hurt. Like... I feel completely invalidated. she is essentially taken how I feel and dismissed it, even turning it around to make it somehow my fault that she made the comment in the first place.Since then (about 2 hours ago) I have been thoroughly distressed and honestly having to resist the urge to self harm, biting my fingers and slapping myself, etc.she is now asleep and I honestly do not know what to do. I feel awful and honestly betrayed at the response I have received but at the same time stupid for being so hurt over something so seemingly trivial. Am I over reacting?

17027,"When I was barely over the age of one, cps took me away from my birth mom. Needless to say, I was found in a terrible state. The very first family to take me in as a foster child, eventually they were able to adopt me when I was 3. Sadly though, I was forced to continue my relationship with my mother throughout the years I was a foster child, which was ultimately detrimental in how I ended up. Luckily it was a closed adoption, sadly though, the parents who had adopted me, had divorced a few years later. My mom got me and the other kids, while occasionally we would see our dad. Though, my mother would rarely let me see my father. It was obvious from the start, I was different from other kids. I look back on it, and I realize just how much of a struggle I had to deal with. I attended special classes for my speech impediment, I was always getting bad grades and I just did not understand ANYTHING. Instead of getting me help, my mother did not believe in medicine or doctors. I just recently found out that she knew I always had ADD, but never told me. She would ground me for not crying when someone I did not love, would die. I was always getting grounded and I was never allowed inside the house. No matter how hydrated I would get, she would not allow me inside, and she worked me like a slave. Only ever cleaning when I was inside. Eventually I ended up living with my dad and his new wife when I became a teen. I ended up getting caught having sex, and my father who was extremely strict, grounded me for years. I started getting treated like I was a dirty person, and that they would not feel comfortable allowing such a person around their kids. And to this day I am still treated like this. What more, I went back and forth between my mom and dad, eventually I was kicked out before I could graduate and have struggled ever since. I always struggled with depression, but as soon as I became an adult, I started truly feeling suicidal and depressed. I started coming out to my family, who I have Always had a rocky relationship with, and was always shut down and told to stick it up. They ignored my pain and suffering, and I refused to ever ask help from any of them. But my sister would always have my back, she would make sure I would not be homeless. And now I just find myself in a rut. I am in the first relationship I have had for years and its terrible. He deceived me into believing he was someone else, and like an idiot, I feel for it. he is made us get into tremendous debt, and now I find myself the lowest I could ever be. I have no motivation and I know I just cannot keep doing it anymore. I am tired, and I do not care to live. I do not care what happens after this, I just want to be set free from this misery. I also cannot help but resent my father, he has so much money yet he refuses to help anyone. He says to work hard, even if it means work 24/7, since he is an alcoholic. But I just struggle so much, and the fact that he is out there spending ridiculous amounts of money on the dumbest of stuff, but not on helping out his child that is struggling so much, who finally admitted to him that I have been suicidal.I have come to realize that all the abuse I went through as a child, has damaged me in a way that I can never hope to be normal. I still have a speech impediment, but I have learned to become the silent character. I know that I have some form of autism, I have looked up all the signs and I have worked so hard to understand myself. I do not want to be here anymore, and I guess really, I just want to be heard.

I let myself think that people just put up with me, but I am told otherwise, why do I still feel like I am just an obstacle to others around me? I have been here before, wondering why I exist, because there is nothing waiting for us at the end of the road, what is there to look forward to?

Needing an education, a job, have a hobby, making friends, seeing other relatives, have a routine, keep things tidy, do this, do that and the list goes on and on...How am I supposed to manage all of this?

8932,"I am a 17(f) Lately I have been feeling more and more depressed, I look back at my old self and how I used to be when I was younger. I used to be filled with life and always hang out with friends I had a good relationship with my family I would say that that was probably the best part of my life so far sadly:/I cannot even look at myself in the mirror I always avoid mirrors because I hate myself.Coming from a mexican household my mother does not believe in mental health problems. She always says ""you have food, clothes, and a roof over your head! Why are you sad? You should be grateful for all the things you have.""My parents are divorced, I have 3 siblings but the oldest left to live on their own. My oldest brother had a huge argument with my mom and they have not spoken/seen each other for four years. I also have a 2nd oldest brother who has Autism, he is also mute and he pretty much needs help with everything. he is pretty calm and does not look like he has special needs, but he makes noises which annoys me and I feel bad for being embarrassed/annoyed with him. Right now I am living in an apartment with my mother and Autistic brother. My mom has to work 24/7 so that means that I have to look after my brother which feels like a full time job. I can never go out without bringing him along because I cannot leave him alone I am already embarrassed by him so I cannot even go out. I feel like even if I wanted to move out I could not because I have no money and I have no opportunity to go and make money for myself. My father is also pretty absent in my life:/I also have no friends because my best friend of 8 years and my friend group decides to exclude me out. I was bullied by them my sophomore year.I feel like I am stuck, everyday is the same. I do not see a reason that I should keep waking up everyday. I am not pretty or skinny so that does not help either. I just want to pause my life and breathe and to go be able to do the things I want to do but I cannot.

47235,"I can’t think of another reason why i am the way that i am, can you guys share your experiences I’m on medication and i do all the things people recommend, i got a bike for university so that i’d stop being sedentary, i try to keep my room clean and i even force myself to go out with friends and socialize.

But i realized i don’t enjoy socialization, they say humans thrive on socialization, but I don’t feel that I do.

People feels like a chore for some reason I never really miss my friends or miss going out with them.
Every time they ask me to go out I make up an excuse and humor them and on the rare occasion i did go with them I would go home early. They will try to prolong the outing as much as possible. Maybe have a couple of drinks and play video games late into the night but I genuinely can’t find it in me to wanna be around them and it isn’t about them as people they’re actually very sweet and accepting wonderful people. 

They are kind hearted and patient and one of them even cooks for us sometimes it isn’t about them. I’m not sure what’s wrong with me but I just can never seem to enjoy being around people it’s supposed to be healing to be a part of a community to feel like you belong, to go out with friends and to get out of the slump you are in. 
 
A lot of people tell me it’s not good to lay in bed all day or to be in inside your apartment, watching YouTube and movies and playing video games alone but I genuinely feel that I don’t have the same functions that other humans do I don’t have the thing that makes me want to be around others. It just isn’t an emotionally fulfilling experience. 

I don’t feel the need to be around other people and whenever I do go out with people, I look forward to just going home and relaxing and finally breathing and doing whatever i want.
I’m not sure why maybe it’s a personality clash? Maybe I just haven’t found my “people“ or someone that really understands me to the point where I would find their company enjoyable? I’m not sure all I know is I’ve never really had a friend that I wanted to spend that much time with if it were up to me, I would go weeks maybe even months without ever hanging out with friends even though I know it might be better for me mentally if I’m around people and put myself out there and meet new people as well but I genuinely do not crave human presence in my life and the happiest or at least the most content I’ve ever been is when I’m alone reading comics and drinking coffee in my bed.

It isn’t like I don’t want to have friends I really do, when I have friends I just don’t really see their presence or company as a priority or a need in my life other than a conversation every now and then I never really seem to want to spend my free time on them.

I’ve been like this my while life even during middle school.

21796,"Recently I have been having obsessive thoughts about my intelligence and abilitied or lack thereof and I cannot shake them.I have just been offered a dream job but my self-confidence has plummeted as I have been preparing for it. I know the stress of preparing for it has definitely kicked off a lot of feelings of being insecure in my abilities but I think it goes deeper than that. I just get stuck in these thinking ruts and my mind becomes completely cloudy - I have talked through some of these feelings before and it seems like when I have a problem I start either putting up invisible barriers or I think of all the things that could go wrong and it ends up closing off my mind to solutions before I even get a chance to think anything through. I cannot catch a thought and hold onto it long enough to solve anything - my mind just keeps spinning from problem to problem with no solutions. And I have always had this issue to some degree but I could work through it until several months ago, when I was offered this job. I went from feeling comfortable and relatively confident before, to feeling like I do not measure up to anyone around me. Suddenly I am not talented enough or I am not intelligent enough or I am not creative enough or I am not likeable enough when I am around other people. And I know part of this is my on perception working against me but for some reason I cannot shut it off; it is like the irrational, scared part of my brain is taking over. It makes me feel completely disconnected from the people around me and I end up feeling terrible and not confident about myself. I have read about the concept of a growth mindset vs a fixed mindset; that embodying a growth mindset helps you overcome feeling stuck by believing you can grow as a person whereas a fixed mindset leaves you stuck in a rut. Just rationally, I know I should have a growth mindset to believe that I can grow and change but my emotions are overwhelming my ability to choose that - something in me is constantly telling me that I am stuck being a failure, that I do not deserve good things, and that I have only made it as far as I have due to sheer luck. Does anyone have experience successfully fighting off those feelings? Self-confidence relapse",Depression

Constantly thinking how to say things, what tone to use, is this an appropriate answer to this persons question and incredibly frustrated at my lack of real connection with anybody. Even my cognitive function I feel has gotten weaker, like a bon fire that has simmered down To a candle light. I started blaming the isolation with my family and now I think it was marijuana use.

I have ADHD and anxiety and one of the things that I do is that I cannot function if my hands are dry so i carry around lotion with me.

7145,"reccently i read over some messages between me and a previously close friend from a few years ago. during the messages i was going through a depressive episode and we were talking about it together. however, the messages i sent were kind of toxic and i was being very unfair. she was trying to help me and i would reply with k or refuse to say what is wrong because it does not matter. i would also send worrying messages and then not reply for long periods of time, which would make them very anxious. i do not want to be the person i was in those messages, normally i would consider myself to be a kind and friendly person, and id like to think that I have somewhat improved in the last few years, but I have been noticing that during depressive episodes i have a tendency to regress to this blunt and rude way of speaking to people. i know that depression means you cannot feel as much for the other person, and it definitely makes you feel like no one else cares, but i do not want to use it as an excuse and continue to treat my friends badly. a lot of the time i do not even realise I am being like this until afterwards, but I am appalled by how I have acted. i would appreciate if anyone has any tips to get themselves out of the nobody cares about me attitude, or any similar experiences.many thanks my depression makes me into someone i do not like",Depression

Until 13 girls never talked to me because I was not the cool guy who ran fast, I was rather the quiet kid. During middle school I had some friends but no girls seemed to like me. So I convince myself girls should not like me. Probably because I am ugly. But in first year of high school, I fell in love for a girl. And after 1 year, she and I started a relationship. I was really really happy, but 2 months after, she left me for no reason. And this is the beginning of my depression. During the first months, I have never gone outside my house, I have tried killing myself twice. I was totally depressed, I did not want to live anymore. A part of me has disappeared, and I have not found it yet. After 18 months, I feel better, but something is not the same since. I have no more self confidence. The self confidence I gained during my relationship disappears 2 months later. Now I am sure people cannot like me. But here is the problem. I really like a girl, but I know she is way out of my league. And I think she will reject me so I do not try anything. I do not know how. So I think I will be lonely forever, because I am too afraid.

I had exams coming up around 10-14 days later (from the date of the appointment) so I figured I would take the new medicine after it was over because it took me quite a while to get adjusted to Bupropion.However I did some research on the drug and saw it had a few side effects which made me worry alot. I have ADHD, and the side effects for Paroxetine were nervousness, forgetfulness, difficulty in concentration and I really do not want that to get heightened because I already have those (unmedicated for ADHD). It also had weight gain as a side effect and I had really bad body image issues &amp; disordered eating last year so I feel like I might spiral if I gain weight I do not intend to. How do I tell her I do not want to take the additional drug? Bupropion is working well for me and I made a few lifestyle changes which has made me feel a lot better this past month. I am in a much better place now and I do not feel like I need or want it.

48069,"I don’t want to care about being alone I’m 40(M) and I’ve always maintained that I’m too ugly for women and that hasn’t changed.  Then my not long ago my therapist talked me into using a dating app to get experience to chatting with women and to get over fears of rejection.

I didn’t like the idea but I did it anyway.  Well I think it is fair to say that it was the final straw, because the only women who were (allegedly) interested were women in foreign countries, sure they were highly educated (they claimed) and quite a few of them were not bad looking but I zero matches from us women.

Long story short, I was talking to this female doctor in the Dominican Republic and most of our conversations had to be done with google translate because she didn’t speak much English.  Well after a while I realized that this was going nowhere and I politely told her that we needed to go our separate ways and unmatched her.

A few days later I decided that enough was enough, I think it’s beyond reasonable doubt that I’m too ugly and need to just embrace being alone for life.   But my brain won’t let me, I keep having to remind myself to not go back to the app, to just find ways to help people and be content alone but again my mind keeps obsessing about being alone so that I find myself needing to vent several times a day and it’s pathetic.

I have proof that I’m hopelessly ugly, among other things and need to just stop thinking about it and embrace being alone and stop caring.  I don’t want to care anymore, I want to happy and content with my life.",Depression

He hates learning and have no friends. He's always in his room and refuse to leave. He would lock his door and turn off the lights. When my parents asked him if he wants to go somewhere he just screamed no repeatedly at them. Sometimes when we come back home and I check up on him, he told me he regretted it and said he's a horrible person.

I suggested him to get professional help. I'm also seeing a therapist to try to better myself. But my brother told me it's a waste of time and he doesn't want to talk about his feelings. All he does is play pc games from morning to night. Even till 3 am. My mom comes home from her night shift and when she saw that he's still awake they started a screaming match. Their loud voices would wake me up and I try to stop them and it never works.

Now I just check up on him and try to have a decent conversation with him. I would talk about video games with him or other things he's interested. But most of the time he yells at me to leave his room.

I think he has a lot of pressure from my mom. She wants him to go to college in the medical or engineer field. It might be partially my fault too. My mom wanted me to be a nurse but I got a degree in art. Even my relatives told me ""you can't have 2 siblings in the creative field. There has to be a balance. Your brother should be in stem."" I asked my brother and he actually wants to be a writer. I feel bad, I don't think I'm a good older sister (I'm 25). I focused on my own issues for a long time now. I also tried defending him against my family but he told me to stop. My brother ended up yelling at me that I'm a failure because it took me 6 years to graduate, got a useless degree and tons of job rejections. So he doesn't want to take any advice from me about college. He always tells me this when he wants to be alone because I ended up crying to my room or the bathroom.",Depression

I see no meaning of life at all but this is not due to my psychology but my philosophical approach to life. I am an existentialist in a way. Plus, to me, there is no meaning of suffering in life as other toxic positive people claim that suffering makes us strong bla bla. Why would I suffer? I want to have fun in life which also leads to laziness for me sometimes. However, my feelings are generally negative. How can I overcome my anguish, anxiety, and distress? Is there helpful approach of psychotherapy for me? I am also in an alert state all the time that other people might harm/hurt me (due to survival instincts; for instance, in business or for money). This also causes my anxiety. &amp;#x200B;I appreciate any thought, idea, and help. Thank you :) How can I overcome my feelings of anguish, distress, anxiety, and existential pain?",Depression

I cannot afford the gym, or healthy food, or a nice quiet apartment, or my hobbies. So then I get depressed anyway.I am really scared. I am scared things will not get better.

Just wanted to get something off my chestIm 22 recently graduated from college I found out at half one this morning thst i was rejected for my dream job (througha friend thst got onto the next stsge) . Another rejection to add to the list. I have already been rejected by all the other msjor companies in the field I am graduating into in this country. I am a laughing stock and a waste of space. A let down to my fsmily and all my dead relatives whom I promised that i would make proud. I have not. I cannot put myself through another interview process. How could I? I will be turned down . I know I am good at what I do but nobody can see that. The people who matter do not have faith in me. what is wrong with me? Why am i so useless as a person? As for my personal life? Another stream of rejections. Any time I get close to somebody romantically it takes them about 3 dates for her to realise I am a waste of their time. I am not a horrible person either. Quite the opposite I have been told that too often I am too nice to people. Maybe that is my lack of worth as a person manifesting itself through helping somebody else. I do not hate my life i just hate that I am who I am . I wish I could be anybody else. Somebody of worth. Somebody that is not humiliated every time they do an interview, every time they ask a girl out, everytime they think they are getting somewhere. Why bother? I am a waste of breath and I wish i could change thst but I am too far gone. Before you think my ill feeling towards myself manifests itself in interviews etc it does not i cover it up. And the last time i was told i was not good enough for a job ie todsu it was not even an interview as such but a task. I do not even know why I am posting this. It is not a cry for help, it is not a pity me fest. it is more so a case of needing to get it off my chest. Sorry for being a burden not only to you but onto my fsmily and my wider social circle.

I was always on 100 mg zoloft &amp; then switched to 20 mg lexapro in 2018, but went off of them for about 6 months in 2021 to try to live without them. At the end of those 6 months I started to get dizzy more often &amp; have what I can only describe as uncontrollable thoughts. Not suicidal or thoughts of harming anyone, but I just did not feel in control of my emotions and I felt like I was gonna lose my mind lol &amp; very depressed. So I got back on lexapro 20 mg &amp; after a few months I started to feel average at best but better than before. August 2022 I started to get brain zaps/dizziness every day for over a month so I went to a new psychiatrist and got back on Zoloft 50 mg to start. I worked my way up to 75mg &amp; started to feel a lottttt better, but in December my dad died and I was extremely close to him so that obviously set me back. I went up to 100 mg around Feb 2023 and have been having issues ever since. Very dizzy, lots of anxiety &amp; panic attacks, and the weird uncontrollable emotions/thoughts and always feeling on the brink of a panic attack have been happening since. It gets A LOT worse at night and that’s when most of my issues arise.
Within the last 6 months I’ve seen an ear doctor to make sure I didn’t have inner ear issues causing dizziness, an eye exam (I got a small prescription mostly for being on my phone/computer or reading), and I got an MRI done and saw a neurologist.

11277,"I really do not know where to begin. I am 38 years old and on my second marriage (this will be explained in detail) This marriage also includes a 6 year child (that is not mine by blood but I still claim as my own). I am feeling really down right now and there has not been anything that can lift me up as I keep finding shit that brings me down. I am really trying to find to positive side of things but it just has not been possible. Now, here is a long story of why I just cannot seem to get a break...My first marriage was medicare at first. I honestly did not want to be with her but she won me over and I married her.. We had many years of happiness and life events (buying house, cars, etc). I ended up losing my job and joining the army to make ends meet and try to progress our status in life. I was gone from home for at least a year for training then another 6 months for orders due to premobilization of my unit. Shortly after I was off to iraq for 16 months. Needless to say I was away from my wife and home for quite a long while but I was paying the bills and trying to give her a life she enjoyed.During my mid tour leave I decided to give her a chance to ""come clean"" with any doings that I would have a major problem about (mainly cheating). She said she started smoking weed but that was all... I do not mind weed but I did not want her hobby to interfere with my security clearance so I asked her to stop by the time I got home. Fast forward a while and I found out through her computer that she was sexting another guy, a cop (this will play a part later in the story) and they were sending pictures and videos back and forth along with skyping all dating back to the time I was in Iraq. The first time I found out abou it I told her I wanted a divorce and left our house to live with my friend. She made a Deal with me that she would go through an uncontested divorce if I moved back in and went to marriage counseling. If that did not work out then she would grant me my divorce. Win win for me I thought....One of the conditions of the consousling was I was able to check her phone whenever I wanted to assure myself that no communication was happening with the cop. I did not find any for months. But I decided to put her to a test and see deleted the dude from her Facebook. All while making sure that I could see her text messages even if she deleted them. It was not but hours before I found the first text between them. They were not suppose to be communicating at all and she was trying to hide her tracks by deleting her messages. Then I laid another trap, I left for military stuff for a month or so and decided to ask her for nude pictures. My goal was to see if she sent the pictures to the cop. I got the pictures I asked for, and so did the cop... I immediately started the procedure to divorce this woman... Now on the the part that hurts the most. I found a woman that made me so happy and I found her during the finalization of my divorce. This woman was everything straight from the start. I told her ever single detail of my life and everything between. I even left the military for this woman ( I wanted a family and the military is not conducive to that). She already had a baby but that was fine with me. I fell so in love with this woman I asked her to marry me. We got got married, then tragedy, again.Our young relationship did have quite a strain. We bought new build houses twice within 2 years and then our house was hit with a tornado. We lost a friendship with someone that took us in to live with them, we lived in a hotel for a few months then covid hit and everything locked down. We managed to move into an apartment during this time but it was still difficult. I managed to get t-boned in my truck in which I broke 3 ribs, punctured a lung, and was knocked un conscious. So we had that to deal with. Eventually my new family found its way back into out newest ""tornado"" house. After we worked so hard to get it repaired.Mere months later I found out my wife was sexting with a cop. Keep in mind, this is wife #2 now, doing the same thing as wife #1. We are in marriage counseling now but it does not feel like it is helping. As of late I have been asking her if she is still thinking about this guy and she is flat out lieing about it.Tonight I found it she was upset over the fact that this shitbag found another girlfriend and that she thinks about him everyday and that she 100% knew there was a connection between them.Also, fuck sexlife on Netflix because she feels that while the physical portion of that show did not happen, the mental part did with the cop, I found that out tonight as well so yay me... Life for the last 15 years has been such garbage I wished I died in Iraq. Noone else to talk to...",Depression

7078,"First time posting here and feeling a bit ambivalent about doing so as I have never really been active in this community or helped anyone, so feel a bit self indulgent and selfish posting. 30, soon to be 31. I have had an issue with weed since I was 19 (did not accept I had an addiction until 24 but never made any efforts to address it due to my own self loathing and warped mindframe that I ""deserved"" to be nothing more than an addict and waste of space). Cut down hugely but now that my mind is clearer, I cannot stop thinking about how incredibly shit a person I am. Used to have friends in Uni, drifted from a lot of them due to smoking (I would flake on invites to things and smoke myself into a daze. Rinse and repeat). Got together with someone from a local sporting community I was involved in and had tons of friends in it. I let myself believe that these people actually liked me and that my self-loathing was unwarranted. When we broke up, and I very shortly thereafter suffered a catastrophic leg injury (I can walk again now, thankfully), it became very clear a lot of those people much rathered my ex than myself and I lost what I thought were very close friends. No one bar my family visited me in hospital and none of those friends ever reached out to see how I was. It destroyed me for a while but I talked myself into believing I was better off without people like that. It still stung and I basically have never properly returned to social media or to that community due to feeling so shit and hated (it was very clear that some of them really really did not like me, and a lot of rumours were spread by a dick I had rejected from that community after he had propositioned me. I was not around to defend myself due to the injury and I guess people decided they would rather believe his lies than ask me. A further indication of how low they view me.)That was a good few years ago and I still cannot shake the sense of ""betrayal"" and that I am clearly a POS if all of these people decided they wanted nothing to do with me. Out of sight, out of mind.I feel like anyone who is not family that is still in contact with me is doing it as a favour to me, and cannot shake the feeling everyone actually really dislikes me. I hate myself and find social interaction difficult with people because in the back of my mind I am always telling myself that the person hates me or finds me boring/self indulgent/an asshole etc. This has further made me withdraw as I do not want to inconvenience others. I have a good job I feel I do not deserve, which I am struggling with doing at the moment due to how low I am. I do not see the point in anything and find myself thinking that if I killed myself at least work could hire someone competent. I have a loving boyfriend who is incredible and so patient but due to historic sexual abuse, I can be quite nervous with intimacy. I have only ever once really been able to be in the ""here and now"" in the moment with him without my mind dissociating or me recalling the abuse. I have found myself thinking if I killed myself, he could be free to do what he wants and eventually meet someone who is good for him. I have been talking myself out of breaking up with him as I know if I do do that, that is one less obstacle on the path to killing myself. I cannot shake the feeling that I am the worst thing for him and that I am wasting his life when he could be so much happier with someone who deserves him. I have a supportive family. My mum and her partner are great, getting on in life and I find myself getting worried about the 2 of them as they get older and then chastise myself for being kind of ""ageist"". I have a sister, we are not close but we try to be but there is a lot of tension and tbh I do not like her as a person and believe a lot of my self hatred is rooted in some very serious bullying and abuse by her when I was a small kid. I have a brother but he is estranged from the family. We very occasionally check in but it is clear he wishes he was not related to us at times (he has his own mental health issues and I think blames our family for a lot of it.). I have aunts and uncles who are lovely and kind and I love them all very much. But. I feel like if I killed myself it would make everyone is lives so much easier.I can be hard to get on with, and am high strung and have a hearing sensitivity that makes being around loud or shrill noises very difficult. That sadly includes the noises of kids simply having fun and being a bit boisterous. I hate that I get physiological pain just by being around my niece and nephew when they are giddy. I am abnormal and I feel like I bring everyone else down or that they are only nice to me because they feel sorry for me. I cannot stop thinking I am a burden, a waste of space, a nuisance. When I see people I know who are very sick, or people with very serious conditions that impair their quality of life, I feel like an ungrateful POS that I have a working healthy body and yet want to die. I do not deserve my body and keep finding myself wishing there was a way I could trade. I wish that I could give my able body or my natural life expectancy to others. That if I killed myself, the x amount of years I did not live could transfer over to someone else.If I killed myself, my mum and her partner would not have to catch up with me or endure my presence. If I killed myself, my sister would not have to poorly pretend to tolerate me nor pay back a loan I gave her years ago which she keeps dodging. If I killed myself, some of my savings could go to my brother which would hugely help him out. If I killed myself, my extended family would not have to waste any time talking to me at family gatherings and they could actually have some fun. If I killed myself, the majority of my savings would go to my mum and her partner and would help them do some renovations on my mum's house or help her to buy the house of her dreams. If I killed myself, my partner could be free, would not have to mind me, and would also get a whack of my savings which would help him travel the world like he is always dreamed of. If I killed myself, people would not have to be polite to me. If I killed myself, I cease to be a burden (after the funeral has been planned and done). If I killed myself, depending in the means, I could donate my organs and actually do something good with my life for once.I know my mind is clearly twisted right now but I cannot stop thinking that if I honestly just killed myself, everyone else would be so much better off. I am miserable, I constantly try to suppress it or hide it, I feel like people really dislike me or tolerate me and almost all of my friends have drifted away from me. I have no common ground with anyone and my drug addiction wasted so many years where I ultimately have no real hobbies, or interests or personality. I just want to die but know it will hurt my family. Good live from the outside but I just want to press ""off""",Depression

25737,"I am getting a wave of depression yet again and it is keeping me up tonight so I just wanted to talk. Whenever this happens it usually involves self-doubt and loathing, it is so frustrating. I recently graduated from college and this whole transition to adulthood thing is making it exponentially worse. When I talk to my friends about it I just feel like I am constantly burdening them even though they are very supportive. I really love and appreciate them and they are one of the few reasons I am not spiraling out of control. As if depression was not enough, I also suffer from social anxiety (though it has gotten much better than was a few years ago). As you can imagine, that just destroys any bit of personality I have. I provide pretty much little to nothing in conversation between friends and I find it hard to make friends at work or anywhere really since I am so bland and boring. Another problem I have is that my self-hatred really destroys my self-confidence and affects the way I portray myself to other people. It makes me seem less approachable or just not worth approaching. With the frequent waves of depression I have been experiencing lately, I am afraid I am going to start drifting apart from my friends and end up alone. it is just so hard to live feeling like this with these thoughts. I feel like there is a constant pressure on my chest. Now onto some positives about me that I should remind myself about. I am witty and funny once in a while. I get myself up and working when I have to even if I do not want to. I am doing a good job of stepping out of my comfort zone and tackling my social anxiety by working in customer service. I have been putting effort into a hobby I am passionate about and working towards improvement. This is starting to sound like a diary, but I guess that is what my whole account essentially is.

19331,"let us just get straight to it. My dad is an alcoholic. He has been to rehab SIX TIMES. SIX! He has been drinking even before I was born, and he continues to drink to this day. he is drunk right now. When I was 11, I was in baseball, and one day, he showed up at my baseball game completely drunk. I was so embarrassed, and really really hurt. After the game, teammates were making fun of me: ""Hey, I really like your dad. He seems fun."" ""Hey, when is your dad coming to the game next?"" ""Your dad is a real wino."" I was hurt, but, I had to go to the next game, and when I did, one of the teammates brought a can of beer, gave it to me, and said ""I know your dad will love this."" I asked my mom if we could leave. I told her I was not feeling well.I went home, and decided to quit baseball. I told my mom that it was because I was not having fun, but, in reality, I did not want to keep playing because I did not want to keep being bullied by the other kids, and being embarrassed whenever my dad showed up drunk.My dad continued to drink. About 6 years ago, my brother and I visited him for Christmas. I thought it would be nice. On Christmas Eve, he said he was going out to the store. Usually it is about a half hour walk. (He lost his drivers license due to a DWI) He came back, FIVE HOURS LATER, absolutely hammered. On Christmas Eve. I was furious. I wanted to leave, but, I did not want to ruin everyone is Christmas. So, I kept my mouth shut, and cried myself to sleep. Worst christmas I have ever had.I stopped talking to him after that. I ignored his texts, and I came up with excuses to avoid speaking to him. In September of 2019, my supervisor told me she would have to cut my hours. No reason given. I was barely making any money to live on. I could not pay my bills, and for a while, I had to park my car, and walk to work because I could not afford insurance. So, my dad decided to move in with me, and said he would pay the bills.I was really upset with this decision. I did not want him to move in with me, but, I had no other choice. Ever since then, I have had to deal with his drinking. CONSTANT DRINKING. I have screamed at him, and pleaded with him to stop drinking, and he does not listen. I have even grown to dread the sound of a can opening.About 3 months ago, my 17 year old little brother came over. My dad decided to get shit faced. He was acting like a dick, and was just being obnoxious. My brother ended up leaving, and went home. My mom texted me, and told me he came home crying. My 6 foot 7 inch tall brother, who weighs 280 lbs, cried because of my dad's behavior.On Monday, my dad decided to start drinking at 11:45 in the morning. 4 hours later, and plenty of beers later, he asked me to take him to the store. I was hesitant, but, I took him. We get inside, and already my father is embarrassing me. I go off to get what I needed, and I realized I forgot my wallet in the car. My dad pays for me, and I thanked him twice for that. I paid him back when we get back in the car, and we head home. On the way home, my dad starts acting like a dick. He starts mocking me, and going ""thanks for the money, dad."" Even though I thanked him twice. I was on edge at that point. I responded ""I already thanked you twice, you idiot."" Was it the best thing to say? No. But, I was really upset. He got upset for me calling him an idiot. We get home, and I am walking up the porch. He throws an empty bottle at my head; and that was it. I had snapped. I turned, walked down the steps, and approached my father, and punched him right in the jaw. I knocked him out. He was out for a good 3 minutes.He regained consciousness, and I helped him inside. I do not really know how to feel about it, though. I feel good for standing up for myself after dealing with a dismal father. But, I also feel terrible because he is my father. I really do not know how to process all of this. Even 2 days later. I punched my father.",Depression

21002,"Belief is single handedly the most important thing you can have in this life. Do you remember how as a kid everything felt so much more hopeful and magical so much more exciting. We often times even get nostalgic about these forgotten feelings and we are left with nothing more than a tinge of sadness after. Then you grow up and realize what a cruel and dark place the world can be, that it is not the magical place you thought it was as a kid. That- no we cannot blow a dandelion and wish to fly, that marrying a prince and becoming a princess is not the top thing on our priority list anymore, or that happily ever afters are a nonexistent reality. We realize these things and so we stop believing. We stop believing in most dreams from big ones to small ones and they are replaced instead with anxiety, fear, rejection, low self esteem, and/or depression limiting ourselves from reaching our full potential. We think our dreams are stupid now. That they are a waste of time and non realistic. But would you ever look at your four year old niece who thinks that one day she will build a blue house on a cloud and think wow this kids pretty stupid, obviously clouds are just a collection of liquid droplets which would never be able to hold the weight of a house and even if it was able to, how would you even get up to a cl no. We think this type of imagination is precious and pure, or at least I do. we used to ask why cannot I become____? But the question now becomes what is the point?. We think we are more wiser now, more logistical there is no time for childish dreaming anymore when there is work to be done to earn a living to eat sleep repeat and die.

12510,"TWI've gone on a very bad downward spiral again recently. I tried to take my own life back in '18, spent some days in the psych ward. Some of you have probably been there, too.Since then, I have not really gotten better - I have just crawled my way into surviving with a strenght I was not sure I had. Two weeks after the attempt I went back to work, and I now realize damn, that is so f\* up. It was like ""now hurry up and be profitable again""I quit that job last year, before the pandemic. Since then, I tried to get another job. I recently landed one which I was really hoping was just going to be something I could handle. Woop-dee-doo. How do I fool myself every time. Two months later, here we are - I collapsed, hard, this time more from my anxiety than from my depression. I just told my boss I was sick until I could figure out what to do. I called my psych; she knows me well. She told me she suggested at least a month off. I know this company would kick me to the curb if I take one month off, so I though it was better to resign saying I got another job offer, patch it up, bye bye.What else can I do other than try my hardest to fix the things this mental illness causes as best as I can? Nothing else.My mom understands. Not everything, because no one who has not had a mental illness can fully understand it. But she is supportive. she is been my anchor all this time. She is the sole reason I am typing today; I would, no doubt, be gone if she were gone. Things is, I moved back here last year, after quitting my job. The reason I moved was because my grandma, who I was living with since 2012, had a stroke and now needs a full-time caregiver. it is a two bedroom apartment, so I had to get out. I guess my stepfather, who ""sees me as daughter"" (pft) has not really liked that. I guess he feels, like always, as if I were here to try and steal my mom or something. I actually felt bad and I thought maybe I am being an obstacle between a couple, even though being honest and kind to myself (quite rare) I have helped the hell out of them after he was diagnosed cancer last year and I took care of the house while they were gone.I think now he just wants me out. I am quite impressed at his lack of care despite being a firsthand witness of my attempt in '18. I asked my mom because I felt something was off (they are gone til tomorrow). She said he, I quote, ""is worried that I will never be able to live on my own.""I do not know if she does but I do see the meaning behind those words. it is a not very subtle ""get out of my house and leave me alone with my wife"". I guess I should have seen it coming, knowing the only love that is unconditional is my mom's. As I wrote down this post I calmed down a little bit. Right now I need to get back on my feet. I will resign from this job because there is no way I can handle it next week, or ever. I will work with my psychiatrist to get me back to ""semi functional"" as I like to call it. Then I am grabbing my money and I am getting the hell out. Screw this. Screw him and his expectations. He can shove his fake care and love up where light does not reach. He has the nerve to judge me, the nerve to expect me to go on after I collapse, when he has two kids (32 and 27) who have NEVER. WORKED.NEVER.I guess I kind of answered myself in this post, but I would still appreciate any input you might have. I feel stronger now. I feel angry. that is good - angry is better than guilty. Eventually I know I will just let go of him, because I do not live with resentment. How am I going to manage once I leave? I have no clue. But I cannot manage here anyway, either. And if I am not wanted, then I shall go.The good side of me still wishes him good. The good side of me cries at how stupid I am, because amidst having a mental breakdown I felt so happy that yesterday he was told his cancer treatment ends next month. I was so genuinely happy, because I do love him. I guess I am just not loved back. And you can tell me ""he loves me in his own way"", but I do not believe in that. You either love someone or you do not. Thank you for the space. I will be down, and up, and down, and up again. But I think eventually, I will just pack up my things and go. And remind myself, yet again, every day, that love is absolutely conditional.

Soul relics Museum is a platform for people to read and tell stories of mental health through objects that help them connect or express to a present or past experience they have had with their mental health. It’s a unique and creative idea to help people come forward and share with others what mental health problems have been like for them and a safe and constructive way to read of others experiences while being brave enough to share your own. Together, we can create a collective voice in raising awareness and education on mental health!",Normal
